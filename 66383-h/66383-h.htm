CHAPTER I.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE MOVEMENT AND THE MAN.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">It</span> was a brilliant afternoon in late spring, and Vindobona was
taking its pleasure joyously out of doors, as is its wont. The many
parks and gardens of the city were crowded with holiday-makers in
every variety of national costume and speaking the tongues of all the
earth, and in the boulevards of the Ringstrasse a well-dressed throng
made the pavements almost impassable. There was not a vacant seat to
be found at the rows of tables outside each café, where strange and
wonderful liquids were being consumed in vast quantities, but with a
deliberation that implied the possession of unlimited leisure. No one
seemed to have anything to do but to walk and talk, salute his
acquaintances and criticise the rest of the world, pause for a while
to refresh the inner man and then saunter on again, and this was
indeed the case. The true citizen of Vindobona always has time for
holiday-making, whatever other duties he may neglect, and those who
make a study of his weaknesses calculate confidently upon this amiable
peculiarity. This saint’s day afternoon, for instance, there were
gathered, in a room on the second floor of one of the palatial
mansions in the Opera Ring, four men, whose meeting had been
facilitated by the absorption of the populace in its pleasures. One by
one they had made their way to the appointed spot, the private office
of the great financier Israel Goldberg, and here, where a
business-like severity strove with a certain barbaric splendour in the
appointments, they had refreshed themselves with fruit sherbets and
perfumed Eastern tobacco before turning their attention to the matter
upon which they had come together. Some signing of papers and a good
deal of low-toned conversation followed, until at last the host leaned
back in his chair and threw down his pen.
</p>

<p>
“That is well over,” he said, speaking in German. “The movement is on
the verge of realisation; we only await the man.”
</p>

<p>
“Just so,” said the venerable Scythian Jew at his right hand; “we need
our Moses.”
</p>

<p>
“But where is he to be found in this age of doubt and depression?”
asked a sallow-faced young man, with large vague wandering eyes.
</p>

<p>
The remaining person at the table snorted fiercely. “This is the age
of limited liability,” he said. “Our Moses will take the form of a
syndicate.”
</p>

<p>
“With the excellent Texelius as managing director?” asked the
Chevalier Goldberg, with a sympathetic smile. “I think not, my dear
friend.”
</p>

<p>
“I rejoice to hear you say that, Israel,” said the old Rabbi, whose
susceptibilities had been much ruffled by the irreverent remark of Dr
Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said the Chevalier, “although we are business men and this is a
business matter, we must return, I fear, to the old ways. Without the
man to whom I hope to present you this afternoon, our movement would
be like a ship without a captain. You, my good Texelius, bring us the
help of science, in my young friend Rubenssohn we have the support of
literature, and our venerable Rabbi Schaul assures us of the blessing
of orthodoxy, while I myself supply the not unnecessary item of money.
But we must, besides all these, have brains.”
</p>

<p>
Dr Texelius was understood to reply that no gathering which included
himself could be considered deficient in that particular, whatever
might be said of the rest of the company, but his host smiled with
pitying gentleness.
</p>

<p>
“My good Texelius, we all admit that you are unapproachable in your
own line. You have enabled all the half-educated people in Europe to
gabble a parody of your philosophy with more than your own brutality
of language, and have taught them new bad names to call their
neighbours by. But when it is a matter of conducting diplomatic
negotiations of the highest delicacy, something more is needed.”
</p>

<p>
“I see no need of diplomacy,” protested Dr Texelius. “We have the
Grand Seignior’s promise, and we hold the money-bags. The Land is
ours, and we have only to keep it, which is an affair of the sword,
not of the tongue.”
</p>

<p>
“And surely,” said young Rubenssohn, “it is the Gentiles who will sue
for our favour, not we for theirs?”
</p>

<p>
“Israel will become at once the exemplar and the monitress of the
world,” said the Rabbi. “Her central position, separated from the
nations and yet vitally connected with all of them, her theocratic
government, and the purity of her family life, will make her not only
the model state of the new century, but the natural arbitrator in
international quarrels.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier Goldberg smiled again, but less patiently. “My dear good
friends,” he said, “do you think the world and its inhabitants will
all undergo a radical change because Israel has obtained permission
from Czarigrad to re-colonise Palestine? I tell you that as soon as
our scheme is known, it will become the butt for the malice and
jealousy of the whole earth. The hostile nations will unite against
us; our own friends will be swept into the vortex. To enable us to
surmount the crisis before us, we need a leader of such varied gifts
and experiences as it would seem almost impossible to find combined in
a single individual. In fact, there is only one man in Europe, perhaps
in the world, who possesses them, and I expect him here in a few
minutes.”
</p>

<p>
“And who may this heaven-sent leader be?” sneered Dr Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“I see him now, coming round the corner of the Opera-house,” pursued
the Chevalier, who from his seat by the window could obtain a view
through the openings of the sun-blind. “That is he&mdash;the short man with
the light moustache.”
</p>

<p>
“An Englishman, evidently,” said Rubenssohn; “or he would not walk to
keep an appointment when he might drive.”
</p>

<p>
“Right, Herschel my son. He is an Englishman. But,” and the Chevalier
dropped the blind which he had partially drawn up, and turned away
from the window and the sounds of voices, laughter, and crowding
footfalls which it admitted, “he is also a true cosmopolitan. For over
ten years he was a king in all but name, and might, had he cared to do
it, have married a queen.”
</p>

<p>
“What! You too have been taken captive by the Mortimer idea?” cried Dr
Texelius. “Our Thracian friends can’t find words to deplore his loss.
To hear them one might indeed think him Moses and David rolled into
one.”
</p>

<p>
“Is your friend really the man who was Prime Minister of Thracia, and
was overthrown by foreign intrigues the day that the young King
attained his majority, Chevalier?” asked Rubenssohn eagerly. “He has
always seemed to me a heroic figure in an unheroic age.”
</p>

<p>
“What I want to know is, how much are you going to pay him?”
vociferated Dr Texelius, while the Chevalier smiled rather drily.
Before he could answer the question, a deferential servant at the door
announced “His Excellency Count Mortimer,” and ushered in a
grey-haired man, whose keen blue eyes appeared to take the measure of
all the occupants of the room at a single glance.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, my frient! You hef arrifed, den?” cried the Chevalier in English.
“Beholt us all awaitink your pleassure. Dis fenerable clerchymen iss
our goot frient de Rabbi Schaul, and here iss de worlt-renowned
scientist Dr Texelius. Dis younk men iss Herschel Rubenssohn, de Poet
off de Ghetto, a redical in theory, but aristocret by nature.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier laughed meaningly, for while the Rabbi had risen from
his chair and bowed low at the introduction, not without a touch of
the servility of manner natural to one who sees a probable and
powerful enemy in every man of superior rank, Rubenssohn had
half-risen and then resumed his seat, conscious of the critical eye of
Dr Texelius, who acknowledged the stranger’s entrance merely by a nod.
Count Mortimer was accustomed to associate with kings and queens, and
Dr Texelius was an austere Republican, hating an aristocrat, moreover,
as an anomaly in nature&mdash;a specimen which would not allow itself to be
weighed and measured and labelled by his philosophy. Aristocrats
worshipped an absurd fetish called honour, some of the manifestations
of which could by no means be reduced to the profit and loss
denominator to which he referred all human actions, and for some
reason or other these same misguided people regarded themselves as
superior to him. It was evident, at least, that this one did, or what
was the meaning of the scarcely veiled irony in his glance as, after
shaking hands with the Chevalier, he bowed to the rest?
</p>

<p>
“I am fortunate,” said Count Mortimer, “in meeting two gentlemen of
such European reputation as Dr Texelius and Mr Rubenssohn. Of Dr
Schaul I heard much while I lived in Thracia; and when I learned that
he was throwing himself heartily into this movement, it seemed to me a
fact of the happiest augury for the future.”
</p>

<p>
“And pray, noble sir, are we to think the same of your own connection
with the movement?” asked Dr Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“The answer to that question lies largely in your own hands, Herr
Professor. Am I to rely upon your loyal support, or not?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Count,” interposed the host, in German, “these gentlemen are
prepared to support you to the utmost of their power. I have just made
them see that without your kind offices we could have no hope of
success.”
</p>

<p>
“I am glad to hear it, Chevalier. Perhaps it will set our friends’
minds at ease if I explain, first of all, that I derive no pecuniary
benefit from my connection with the movement. A busy man does not take
kindly to an idle life, and I am glad to employ my leisure for so good
an object.”
</p>

<p>
“And do you wish us to understand that you cut yourself off from your
class, and range yourself on the side of Israel in the sight of the
world, purely for the sake of occupation and philanthropy?” snarled Dr
Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“Herr Professor, I am a man who has not a little to avenge. If I
choose to combine my own pleasure with the advantage of your nation,
you will do well to be thankful and accept my help. Do we understand
one another?”
</p>

<p>
“Your Excellency does not mince matters, nor will I. What guarantee
have we that the interests of Israel will not be sacrificed to your
own?”
</p>

<p>
“Your frankness charms me. You have no guarantee. But without my help
the interests of Israel will remain where they are at present.”
</p>

<p>
“Prove it!” shouted Dr Texelius. “How are we to know that you have the
power to do what you pretend?”
</p>

<p>
“Simply by waiting to see. But do not mistake me, Herr Professor. I
believe that you and Mr Rubenssohn enjoy considerable influence with
the Jewish press. If we are to work together that influence must be
employed exclusively and loyally on my side, which is your own. Should
there be the slightest attempt to weaken my position, or to form a
cabal against me among your followers, I shall take my choice between
getting rid of you and ceasing my efforts on behalf of Israel, which
will then be far worse off than it is now. Do I make myself plain?”
</p>

<p>
“Your Excellency’s demand is only reasonable,” said Rubenssohn; while
Dr Texelius spluttered inarticulately. “Such influence as a poor poet
may possess is placed unreservedly at your service.”
</p>

<p>
“And if your influence is used wrongly, my excellent Texelius,” said
the Chevalier Goldberg, “I shall find myself under the painful
necessity of ceasing to finance your newspapers, when the annoyance
will die a natural death.”
</p>

<p>
“My fears are not for myself,” was the sulky response. “If the Gentile
is loyal to Zion, he shall have my support. But what reason is there
for his joining us, and what good can he do us? That’s what I want to
know.”
</p>

<p>
“Friend,” said the Rabbi reprovingly, “if the noble gentleman is
willing to forsake his own people and cast in his lot with Israel, is
it for us to sneer at his chivalrous offer and throw doubt upon his
motives? Surely he is one of the sons of the stranger who shall build
the walls of Zion.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril Mortimer bowed gravely to the Rabbi. “I give Dr Texelius free
leave to trust me in private no further than he can see me, provided
that he supports me in public,” he said. “And now that this is
settled, perhaps we may come to a clear understanding of the position.
Through my friend the Chevalier Goldberg I am informed that you,
gentlemen, form the executive of the guild called the Children of
Zion, that your object is to colonise Palestine with Jews from Europe,
buying out the present inhabitants where necessary, and that you are
in command of a certain sum of money for this purpose, invested on
proper security in a series of commercial schemes?”
</p>

<p>
“Of which the control is in Jewish hands,” interjected Dr Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“Quite so. I understand also that the Chevalier has volunteered to
bear the entire cost of obtaining the necessary concession from Roum,
leaving you at liberty to devote the whole of your trust-funds to the
work of colonisation. Indeed, gentlemen, you are to be congratulated.
What with a sum of money to be paid down at the outset, and a yearly
rent for the province, together with the necessary compensation,
palm-oil, and perquisites, my friend will sacrifice a very large part
of his fortune in giving your movement a favourable start. I honour
his motives, and I only hope you appreciate his generosity.”
</p>

<p>
“If Goldberg had shown this generosity ten years ago, the Land would
be already repopulated by a thriving race of colonists,” said Dr
Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“There, Herr Professor, you are in error. The Chevalier could not show
this generosity ten years ago for two reasons. In the first place, it
has been the labour of years for him to establish the agreement now
arrived at between the Jews of all nations, by which they bind
themselves to assist the Children of Zion by bringing pressure on
their respective Governments when it is needed. Without this
solidarity of action, a band of selfish plutocrats in any one country
might have overthrown the whole scheme. And in the second place, ten
years ago I was not at liberty to devote myself to assuring the
success of the movement.”
</p>

<p>
“Which is now secured by your Excellency’s adhesion.” The tone was
sarcastic in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
“You are very good, Herr Professor. To me it falls to direct the
working of this new machine. Without a single head, to ensure the
application of the pressure at the right moment and the right spot,
the financial union would soon break up, or at best fall to pieces. It
is my aim to produce the necessary effect before disintegration sets
in, and I may say I have every hope of success. The Children of Zion
may colonise Palestine, but it is the United Nation Syndicate that
will make their work possible.”
</p>

<p>
“Under your Excellency’s guidance.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope so. You will perceive now the necessity there is for absolute
unanimity. Our enemies will be on the watch for the slightest sign of
dissension. There is one point upon which it may be desirable to give
you a special warning. You are aware of the fanaticism of the
Scythians and others with regard to the Holy Places? Now I think it
highly probable that I shall be obliged to consent to the appointment
of a Christian prince as governor-general, as a guarantee against
their desecration.”
</p>

<p>
“Oho, the thin end of the wedge!” cried Dr Texelius. “A Christian
governor&mdash;a prince, too&mdash;with a Christian Court and army and
executive. Where is our free and independent republic, in which the
Jew might at last obtain security and justice? Rubenssohn&mdash;Rabbi&mdash;you
have heard the Gentile speak, will you still believe that his forked
tongue utters truth?”
</p>

<p>
“Friend Texelius, you insult his Excellency,” said Rabbi Schaul. “How
can it signify to us what precautions the Gentiles take in the vain
hope of maintaining their ascendancy over Zion? Of what use would it
be to us to draw up the wisest republican constitution, which would
last but a day? Once we are restored to the land, He will come whose
right it is to reign, and neither Christian prince nor atheistic
republic can stand against Him.”
</p>

<p>
“Beautiful dream!” murmured Rubenssohn, his eyes kindling, “but it is
only a dream. A literal Messiah is an impossibility. The house of
David is extinct, the monarchical principle incapable of revival among
us. The Grand Seignior may play the part of the Messiah in bringing us
back, or there may be before us a Messianic age of peace and plenty,
such as the prophets picture, but we need look for nothing more.”
</p>

<p>
“Young man, will you limit the Holy One of Israel? A few years ago
this return, for which we are planning, was counted impossible, but it
is now at hand. The appearance and reign of Messiah will follow in due
time.”
</p>

<p>
“Rabbi, you are a dreamer!” cried Dr Texelius angrily. “Will you allow
your absurd visions to interfere with practical politics?”
</p>

<p>
“Visions? You call the prophecies of the Divine Word absurd visions?”
cried the Rabbi, trembling with mingled anger and alarm. “Let me go,
Israel Goldberg. I dare not sit at the same table as this unbeliever.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no; Texelius spoke more strongly than he intended,” said the
Chevalier, whose hair had grown grey in the endeavour to induce the
orthodox and free-thinking sections of his co-religionists to work
together. “He has the highest respect for your views, Rabbi, and I, as
you know, share them.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, let him show his respect for the prophecies by abandoning his
opposition to Count Mortimer,” said the old man, supporting himself
with his shaking hands upon the table, “or I must withdraw from all
association with him, and call upon my flock to do the same.”
</p>

<p>
“I agree,” said Dr Texelius hastily, for the defection of Rabbi
Schaul’s following would have been a serious blow to the movement.
“Perhaps you will own some day, Rabbi, that it would have been better
to take the advice of a practical man, but by all means let us all
become dreamers together.”
</p>

<p>
“If the learned Dr Texelius had listened more carefully to what I
said,” remarked Cyril, “he would have noticed that I proposed only to
consent to the appointment, not to make it. That will be the business
of the Powers, and while they are wrangling over it we are
establishing ourselves in Palestine.”
</p>

<p>
“But they will soon perceive that,” said Rubenssohn.
</p>

<p>
“True; but I shall propose a commission, composed of the various
consuls, to take charge of the Holy Places until the governor is
appointed. That will lead to further wrangling, but it will only give
us more time.”
</p>

<p>
“But why is time so necessary?” asked Rubenssohn.
</p>

<p>
“To enable us to import our Jews. You understand, Dr Texelius, there
must be no interference with Christian communities or forcible
dispossession of Moslems, nothing to give a pretext for European
intervention. If you can’t buy one piece of ground easily, turn to
another. Do everything quietly, settle your Jews wherever there is
room for them, and then we can confidently demand a <i>plébiscite</i> of
the whole country, if we see the opportunity, or at least ask
permission to elect a temporary governor until the Powers have agreed
on their nominee. I need scarcely say that if the colonists possessed
a spark of gratitude, their choice would fall on Dr Texelius, and the
Powers might even be brought to confirm that appointment.”
</p>

<p>
“So!” cried Dr Texelius, with evident pleasure, “I perceive that you
are not wholly a dreamer, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“Few men less so, Herr Professor. We are agreed, then? You will hurry
on your part of the work by every means in your power, while I do my
best to keep the attention of Europe fixed upon side-issues?”
</p>

<p>
“And if you are agreed upon that,” cried the host, when the rest had
signified their assent, “it would be as well for us to separate. I
have been on thorns all the afternoon, lest the police should have
noticed you coming to this house, friends. Unless the movement is to
be rudely checked, you ought all to be on your way back to your own
countries to-night.”
</p>

<p>
At this very plain hint the conference broke up, its members leaving
the mansion singly. The Rabbi went first, shuffling down the grand
staircase in his shabby clothes, a decrepit figure in whom the most
lynx-eyed police agent would have found a difficulty in recognising
the chief spiritual guide of multitudes of orthodox Jews in Pannonia
and Southern Scythia. Rubenssohn, who had lived in England long enough
to pass on the Continent for an Englishman, left the house openly, but
by a different door, after taking a reverential farewell of Cyril, Dr
Texelius utilising the moment by whispering to the Chevalier&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“I have classified your friend, Goldberg. His ambition is enormous,
amounting, indeed, to mania. If Europe will not admire him, Europe may
hate him, but it shall not disregard him.”
</p>

<p>
And Dr Texelius stumped down the stairs with an aggressive air
peculiarly his own, which he joined on this occasion with the
stateliness of demeanour proper to the future president of the Hebrew
Republic. Meeting on the threshold a young Jewish <i>savant</i>, who had
made the great philosopher’s acquaintance at a scientific congress, he
responded affably to the timid greeting of the neophyte, and piqued
his curiosity by informing him that he had just been investigating a
very interesting case of lunacy.
</p>

<p>
Cyril and the Chevalier Goldberg, left alone together, looked at one
another and smiled as the Professor’s footsteps died away.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count,” said the host, “you hef seen our tools. What iss de
prospect off your beink able to work wid dem?”
</p>

<p>
“The Rabbi is a fanatic and Rubenssohn an enthusiast,” was the reply;
“but I had rather work with either of them than with our scientific
friend. There is no one so suspicious as the man who has neither faith
nor enthusiasm himself. However, we can’t afford to have his influence
arrayed against us, so we must make the best of him.”
</p>

<p>
“Den you hef decided to ranche yourself on our side? What are your
plens, my dear Count?”
</p>

<p>
“I think it will be best to go to Ludwigsbad, as I intended. Every one
will be there this season.”
</p>

<p>
“True; all de great people, but you will be greater den any. Oh, my
frient, let me hef my way about dis. You shell treffel like a prince,
you shell hef a whole wink of de best hotel resserfed for you. De
worlt shell see det Israel iss not ungrateful to de Christian det
helps her.”
</p>

<p>
“I thought we had threshed this matter out already, Chevalier. Can’t
you see that the more I am seen to act on my own initiative, and the
less as the agent of the United Nation, the better it is for both of
us? I am the friendly go-between, the honest broker, no more. My
out-of-pocket expenses I will accept, but nothing else, not even a
commission. Living modestly, they can scarcely accuse me of having
been bought by you, the next step to which would be that they would
try to offer a higher price themselves.”
</p>

<p>
“I see you are right, but I must hef your promise det you will not
spare me in de way off expense. Entertainments, chourneys,
telegrephs&mdash;nothink must be wantink det might lighten your labours or
edd to de success off your mission. You promise me dis? And det second
secretary you talked off&mdash;you will let me profide you wid de best I
can find?”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Chevalier, but I won’t have a Jew. Anything that would
identify me in the general mind with your nation is to be avoided. I
think of getting an Englishman, as the fellow will be more for
ornament than use. Paschics is a perfect glutton for work, but when he
is thrown into general society he cannot forget that he began life as
a farm-labourer, and he becomes either servile or truculent. No one
knows and regrets the fact better than he does, and he suggested
himself that I should have some one else to receive visitors and do
the light work, while he grapples with the bulk of it behind the
scenes as he always has done.”
</p>

<p>
“You hef indeed an atteched follower, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>One</i> attached follower, you may as well say, Chevalier, unless you
count my servant, who is a faithful fool of the same sort.”
</p>

<p>
“My frient,” the Chevalier laid aside his smiling mask, and approached
Cyril with intense solemnity as he stood leaning against the
window-frame, “I must ask you once more, hef you counted de cost off
throwink in your lot wid us? At pressent, you are de most successful
failure in Europe. Dere iss not one sofereign det would not obtain
your help if he could, not one state det would not be enxious if deir
enemies were employink you. You are receifed eferywhere, you may merry
whom you please&mdash;for dere are heiresses off de noblest femilies det
would think nothink off gifink you deir whole fortune, if only dey
might accompany it&mdash;you are de frient off all de most powerful people.
Will you gif up all dis for de sake off de oppressed Chews? We know
what contempt&mdash;ill-treatment&mdash;iss like, for we are born to it; but
you, a Christian and a noble, how will you bear it? Dey will treat you
worse den us, for dey will say you are a traitor to dem.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Chevalier,” the sarcasm had left Cyril’s tone, and he looked
at the stout little Jew with an earnestness almost equalling his own,
“you are wasting your pity on me. After the knock-down blow I got two
years ago, I must fight my way up again from the foot of the hill, and
it won’t make it any harder to do it in your cause. What I want is
power, and with reasonable luck I stand to get it by means of this
scheme. As to the personal consequences, don’t trouble yourself about
them. I knew what it was to be socially ostracised long ago in
Thracia, and it did me no harm. I shall continue to be received
wherever I like to go. As to marrying, there is only one woman in the
world that I would choose to marry, and she is out of my reach
already. I am committed to this enterprise, and I have no wish to draw
back. Now what is it that has led you to make me this undesired offer
of release?”
</p>

<p>
“Dere iss noose from Czarigrad,” answered the Chevalier, in a tone in
which relief blended with disappointment. “Chust before our meetink
to-day I receifed a secret message det Hercynia hed discofered our
negotiations wid Roum, and was puttink pressure on de Grand Seignior
to refuse us our concession. Dey must hef heard off your fissit to his
Machesty.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, this is the declaration of war, then! Well, I am glad Hercynia
has opened the ball, because I have such an excellent object-lesson in
store for her. Let me see, Baron de la Mothe von Elterthal passes
through Vindobona to-morrow on his way home from Czarigrad. He will
spend a few hours here with his sister, Countess Temeszy. Count
Temeszy is an old friend of my brother’s, and will get me an interview
without making any fuss. I shall see him to-night at the Opera, and we
will settle things then. To-morrow the Chancellor shall have his
warning, and we shall see whether it is necessary to proceed to
extremities.”
</p>

<p>
“Once you hef approached him on behalf off Israel, dere will be no
drawink-back,” said the Chevalier.
</p>

<p>
“There is none now. Well, Chevalier, I must be going.”
</p>

<p>
“But you will lose no time in seekink det noo secretary?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly not. My brother will help me in the matter. There was a
young fellow hanging about at Llandiarmid the last time I was there
who would suit me well enough, but I daresay he has found something
better to do by this time.”
</p>

<p>
“Farewell den, my frient. You may depend on me to keep you well posted
in all de mofements off de enemy. I hef efery confidence in you, but I
entreat you not to spare expense.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled as he succeeded in making his escape. It would have been
a standing marvel to him, had he been inclined to waste time in
theorising on the weaknesses of human nature instead of profiting by
them, that the great financier, whose name ensured respect throughout
the civilised world, should repose this absolute and deferential
confidence in an unsuccessful statesman, whose sole political capital
was now his vast experience, and a certain strength of head, combined
with coldness of heart, which had much advantaged him in the past. But
Cyril was one who took things as he found them, and made prompt use of
them; and the doglike fidelity with which the Chevalier Goldberg clung
to his fallen fortunes struck him merely as a very serviceable fact,
which, though it might be strange, was by no means to be neglected.
</p>


<h3 id="ch02">
CHAPTER II.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">FIRING THE FIRST SHOT.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Returning</span> to his hotel, Cyril found a letter awaiting him in the
handwriting of his brother, Lord Caerleon.
</p>

<p>
“What’s up?” he said to himself, as he opened the envelope and drew
out the closely written sheets. “Something must be wrong for Caerleon
to favour me with such an imposing epistle. Probably some kind
mischief-maker on this side of the Channel has told him that I have
given myself over body and soul to the Jews, and he is trying to avert
the catastrophe. It would save time to burn the letter and wire to him
that the deed is done, but that might hurt his feelings, so here
goes!”
</p>

<p>
He lit a cigar and sat down with the air of a martyr to read the
letter, but his brow cleared when he found that it contained none of
the anxious entreaties he had expected. His brother needed his help,
it seemed, and the occasion of the request was curiously connected
with the subject of his conversation with the Chevalier Goldberg.
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“You may remember,” wrote Lord Caerleon, “a young fellow named
Mansfield, who prepared Usk for college, and was staying with us when
you were here two years ago. He is a thoroughly nice chap, and as we
all took a fancy to him, Usk has brought him down again two or three
times since he has been at Cambridge. That was all very well, but why
should he take it into his head to fall in love with Phil? I suppose
you will smile your superior smile when you read that sentence; but I
give you my word that the thought of such a thing had never entered my
mind. It’s only yesterday that Phil was about as high as the table,
and running wild about the park with her hair flying loose. How is an
unsuspecting parent to know that she has suddenly grown up, and is
actually old enough to contemplate matrimony? I can tell you it was a
frightful shock to Nadia and me. We sat looking at one another in
consternation, until Nadia rallied sufficiently to remind me in a
faint voice that the child will be twenty-one next month. Many girls
are married before that, as she very truly added, but what comfort
does that afford when one finds oneself all at once regarded as a
stern and venerable elder? Well, as I said, we can have no possible
objection to young Mansfield himself, except on the ground that he has
nothing to do. He is a distant connection of Forfar’s, and has the
promise of a private secretaryship when a vacancy occurs, but that may
not be for years. He has been hanging on at Cambridge since he took
his degree, writing prize essays and (at least this is my private
idea) keeping Master Usk up to the mark; but he sees as clearly as I
do that that can’t go on. He came to me very honourably when he first
discovered the state of his feelings, and said that he did not dare
ask me to sanction an engagement at present, but if he could get some
settled employment, might he speak to Philippa? You know that
desperation will make the most guileless of men artful, and therefore
you won’t wonder that I resorted to a mean expedient in order to keep
my daughter a little longer. I said that Phil was so very young for
her age, and had seen so little of the world (this is absolutely true,
you know), that I should prefer him not to speak to her for a year in
any case. In the meantime he might be getting something to do, and she
should have a London season, and pay a visit to her godmother in
Germany. It was a bitter pill, I could see, but he took it very well,
and left Llandiarmid without saying a word to Phil, so that she knows
nothing about the business. At least, that is my contention; but Nadia
is under the impression that Phil has her own ideas on the subject.
Still, the child is not pining, or I should give way at once. No doubt
she sees, like a sensible girl, that it is the best possible thing for
the young fellow not to be at a loose end any longer. Well, old man,
you see by this time what I want of you. Do you know any one among
your acquaintances who would take an Englishman as secretary, who is
nothing very great in the way of attainments, but has the memory of a
second-class in Modern Languages to fall back upon? He has travelled a
good deal, and is a thoroughly pleasant fellow, rather too literary
for my taste, but there’s no harm in that. He has something of his own
since his father’s death, so that a high salary is not an object; what
he wants is to be set to regular work, and taught to run in harness.
If you know of anything suitable, I will bless you for ever, for my
conscience is pricking me (and I believe Nadia, in her secret
thoughts, blames me too) for condemning Phil and this inconvenient
youth to a lengthy separation just because I don’t want to lose the
child.” ...
</p>

</div>

<p>
Long before he had reached this point, Cyril’s mind was made up, and
his answer to his brother’s letter contained his response to the
appeal made to him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“I want a second secretary, and your Mansfield is the very man for me.
Please write to him at once, and let him meet me at the Hôtel
Waldthier at Ludwigsbad this day week. We shall not haggle about
terms, though Paschics will continue to do most of the work. By the
bye, if association with me is likely to do your young friend harm in
the future, don’t let him come, but if there is no risk of his
suffering in that way, he may take my word for it that he will learn a
good deal that will be of use to him.”
</p>

<p>
About two o’clock the next day Cyril presented himself at Count
Temeszy’s house for his interview with the Hercynian Imperial
Chancellor, who was paying a strictly private visit of twelve hours or
so to his sister. When Cyril’s request was sprung upon him at the
Opera, Gyula Temeszy had declared roundly that there was no prospect
of his brother-in-law’s visiting Vindobona at present. When it
appeared, however, that Cyril was well acquainted with the Baron’s
movements, he not only promised him the desired interview, but invited
him to lunch. This invitation Cyril refused, in view of the
complications which might ensue when Baron de la Mothe von Elterthal
had told his hosts of his discoveries at Czarigrad, and he had reason
to congratulate himself upon his foresight. The Temeszy servants, who
had hitherto bowed almost to the ground before him, received him on
this occasion with a perfunctory civility that was little less than
insulting; and when they turned him over to Baron de la Mothe von
Elterthal’s personal attendant, the man’s manner showed a scarcely
veiled insolence. Ushering Cyril into an unoccupied room, he promised
to carry the noble Count’s name to his master, but added that his
Excellency was very much engaged, and might not be able to see him.
For a quarter of an hour Cyril waited impatiently, within earshot of
the luncheon-room in which, to judge from the noise and laughter, the
Baron was the life and soul of a jovial party, then he rose and rang
the electric bell sharply.
</p>

<p>
“Present my compliments to his Excellency,” he said, watch in hand,
when the servant appeared, “and tell him that as the fifteen minutes I
was able to spare him have expired, I regret not to be able to see
him.”
</p>

<p>
The man, taken aback by this turning of the tables, poured forth a
torrent of apologies and entreaties, but Cyril waved them aside, and
passed down the grand staircase with a calm <i>hauteur</i> of demeanour
which compelled the respect of the servants in the hall. This time
none of them failed in the due observances, and he left the house like
an honoured guest. Before he had gone more than a few steps, Count
Temeszy ran after him, bare-headed.
</p>

<p>
“Pray come back, Mortimer. I can’t think what the servants were doing,
that they didn’t send in your name.”
</p>

<p>
“Sorry I have no time to spare.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense; come back. I can’t let Caerleon’s brother be turned away
from my door like this.”
</p>

<p>
Count Temeszy spoke with evident embarrassment, and Cyril was quick to
draw the inference that he was now only to be tolerated as Caerleon’s
brother. He withdrew his arm from the Hungarian’s grasp.
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Temeszy; but there are doors enough open to me without
darkening those where I am unwelcome. I will tell Caerleon how
faithful you are to your ideas of friendship.”
</p>

<p>
“But my brother-in-law is most anxious to see you. He is awaiting you
at this moment with the greatest eagerness.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Count Temeszy, you only increase my regret that I cannot
possibly spare him another moment. I am lunching at the Café Viborg,
and you must excuse me if I hurry away.”
</p>

<p>
Leaving Count Temeszy disconsolate on the pavement, Cyril disengaged
himself with a ceremonious bow, and walked on. It was without any
surprise that, when he was seated at his lunch a little later, he saw
the Count and his brother-in-law enter the café. Glancing in his
direction as if accidentally, they crossed the room to speak to him,
and almost immediately a friend on the other side of the place claimed
Count Temeszy’s attention. With a muttered apology, he joined him at
his table, and Baron de la Mothe von Elterthal sat down casually
opposite Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“You had something to say to me, I believe?” he remarked.
</p>

<p>
“Not that I know of,” was the disconcerting reply. “Hearing that you
would be in Vindobona, I set aside a quarter of an hour for you for
the sake of auld lang syne, but that was all.”
</p>

<p>
“My brother-in-law understood that you were most anxious to see me. In
fact, he was lamenting all morning that you had refused his invitation
to lunch, until I reminded him that it was perhaps just as well, for
at such short notice it would be difficult to ensure that there should
be no pork on the table.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled. “You are in good spirits to-day, Baron. Still, I would
advise you, as a friend, to let your jokes remain entirely between
ourselves. Other people might fail to appreciate them.”
</p>

<p>
“That is as I please,” snapped the Baron. “Once more, have you
anything to say to me?” as Cyril raised his eyebrows in well-bred
surprise at his tone.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing whatever,” said Cyril, choosing a cigarette with care. “Allow
me to offer you&mdash;&mdash; You will not? No?”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps,” said the Baron darkly, leaning across the table, “you are
not aware that I know all about your visit to Czarigrad, and the part
you played there?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Baron, this is ancient history. I am not aware that there is
any reason why the whole world should not know as much.”
</p>

<p>
“You have no objection to the world’s knowing that you have sold
yourself to the Jews, that you are the paid agent of the enemies of
Christendom?”
</p>

<p>
“If it was true, I should probably object very much. As things are, I
can only admire your simple faith, Baron.”
</p>

<p>
“At least,” said the Baron, changing his tactics suddenly, “neither
you nor your new allies will benefit by your diplomacy on this
occasion. I fancy I have put a spoke in your wheel, my dear Count.”
</p>

<p>
“What!”&mdash;there was unmistakable alarm in Cyril’s voice&mdash;“you have not
been so unwise as to interfere? When it was suggested to me the other
day that you might possibly do so, I laughed at the notion. ‘The Baron
is my friend and a man of sense,’ I said, ‘he could not do such a
foolish thing.’ And now you wish me to understand that you have done
it? My dear Baron, I am deeply concerned. Is there no way in which we
can release you from this very unfortunate <i>impasse</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t understand you,” with evident anxiety. “Surely you are
confusing my position with your own?”
</p>

<p>
“Baron, this is not the time for joking. Is it possible that in the
course of your researches at Czarigrad you never discovered that the
Palestine scheme and your Anatolian concession stand or fall
together?”
</p>

<p>
“Pray, what do you know about the Anatolian concession, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Just as much as I need to know. I am aware that it is of a very
far-reaching character, and that a high and illustrious personage in
Hercynia is determined to obtain it. You could not imagine, Baron,
that I, your friend, could remain ignorant of your troubles of the
last few months? Do you think I don’t know of the immense difficulties
you have had to encounter, and the fact that your Emperor is
graciously pleased to believe that you are secretly opposing his will
and encouraging the Grand Seignior to refuse to grant the concession?
Your continuance in office depends upon your obtaining it, I am well
aware, and now you have deliberately postponed it for an indefinite
time. This is terrible!”
</p>

<p>
“The whole thing is your doing!” burst from the Chancellor. Cyril eyed
him with mild reproof.
</p>

<p>
“This accusation is unworthy of you, Baron, when I am doing my best to
extricate you from your deadlock.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me exactly what your threats are worth. Whether you are a paid
agent of the Children of Zion, or a Quixotic philanthropist,”
sneeringly, “the trap is yours, I know that.”
</p>

<p>
“I have neither the power nor the necessity to threaten. I simply say
that if our concession is refused, yours will be refused also, or if
ours is merely delayed, yours will suffer in the same way. If ours is
granted&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Yes?” with intense eagerness.
</p>

<p>
“Yours will also be granted when the time comes, and Baron de la Mothe
von Elterthal will continue to be the chief ornament of the Hercynian
bureaucracy and the favoured adviser of his sovereign.”
</p>

<p>
“What are they paying you for this?” broke out the Baron. “Thunder and
lightning, man! if you are hard up, why not apply to us? We would have
found some place for you, or screwed a decent subsistence out of
ungrateful Thracia. Why accept the first offer, instead of waiting for
a higher?”
</p>

<p>
“You are agitated, my dear Baron. Take one of these cigarettes, just
to please me, and calm yourself. Did you ever, in the course of our
former dealings together, find that any good came of trying to insult
me?”
</p>

<p>
“Never; I always paid for it dearly. Yes, you are right, I am a fool.
No doubt I am expiating at this moment the errors of my last interview
with you. What?” as Cyril’s impassive face relaxed slightly, “I am
right. Oh, pray consider all that I said about money withdrawn. You
are taking your revenge upon Europe, I see. You would destroy the
world, if you could, to punish the faults of mankind towards you.”
</p>

<p>
“This is very interesting, Baron, but not particularly practical.”
</p>

<p>
“No? Well, tell me, how can you and your Children of Zion, with their
hoarded centimes and kopecks and piastres, hope to oppose yourselves
to the power of the Hercynian empire? We can tire you out at
Czarigrad, simply because we have a longer purse.”
</p>

<p>
“I will let you into a secret, Baron. Try your experiment, and oppose
our concession. You will find that it is not you who will tire us out,
but we you, and for this reason, that you will be pitting yourself
against all the Jews in the world. The Children of Zion are backed by
a syndicate composed of the capitalists of all nations, and Hercynia
would scarcely be well advised to enter on a war with them. I don’t
ask you to accept this merely on my authority. Make the experiment,
and you will see whether the result bears out my warning.”
</p>

<p>
“This is a very serious matter, Count.” The Baron had sat lost in
wonder, supporting his chin on his hand, for some minutes. “Do you see
that you are practically declaring war on Europe?”
</p>

<p>
“Not quite, Baron. It is not necessary for all Europe to oppose itself
to the United Nation. Think of the other side of the picture. What a
future would lie before the country which had the support of all the
Jews in the world!”
</p>

<p>
Baron de la Mothe von Elterthal drew a long breath. “You dazzle me,
Count! Am I to understand this as an offer?”
</p>

<p>
“As a conditional offer,” said Cyril, rising; “conditional on your
supporting us at Czarigrad. I will leave you to think it over, for I
must get back to my hotel, unless I am to lose the train for
Charlottenbad.”
</p>

<p>
“We part as&mdash;as friends, I hope? Gyula,” as Count Temeszy paused near
them, in the course of an impatient promenade up and down the room, “I
am venturing to ofter Count Mortimer a seat in your carriage. We might
drive him to his hotel.”
</p>

<p>
“With the greatest pleasure,” said Count Temeszy, in hopeless
bewilderment, and presently the servants were edified to behold Count
Mortimer seated beside the Hercynian Chancellor in their master’s
carriage, and not only escorted up the steps of the hotel by the man
who had denounced him that morning as a pervert to Judaism, but
fervently embraced at parting. As for Cyril himself, it did not
surprise him in the least to receive, a week later, a cipher telegram
from the Chevalier Goldberg to the following effect:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“Hercynian opposition suddenly withdrawn, after various attempts to
out-manœuvre us in matter of Anatolian concession. Fear secrecy is
now at an end, for business has become known to English journalist.
Suspect Hercynian Embassy at Czarigrad of communicating news, hoping
to rouse Scythia to action.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
“So!” murmured Cyril to himself, in the long-drawn, meditative German
fashion, as he translated the cipher. “Then the battle is beginning in
earnest. That is a smart dodge of yours, my dear Baron, to set Scythia
on our track, knowing that we can’t hope to bring the matter home to
you. I suppose the English papers all revelled in a nice little
sensation yesterday. Mr Mansfield!”
</p>

<p>
Cyril was sitting in the balcony belonging to his <i>appartement</i> in the
Hôtel Waldthier at Ludwigsbad, and a young man came hurriedly to the
window in answer to his summons. There was nothing in any way
remarkable about the new secretary’s appearance&mdash;at least to an
English eye. Brown-haired and hazel-eyed, tall, broad-shouldered, and
carelessly dressed, he would have been passed over at home as “a most
ordinary-looking man,” but on the Continent it was his fate to attract
attention as a typical Englishman wherever he went.
</p>

<p>
“Have you found anything in the papers about our business?” Cyril
asked him.
</p>

<p>
“I was just going to bring your Excellency this.” Mansfield tendered a
Vindobona evening journal to his employer.
</p>

<p>
“Just read me the paragraph. And by the way, don’t ‘Excellency’ me in
private. The King was good enough to continue me in the use of the
title when I left Thracia, but it may be kept for state occasions. And
don’t call me ‘sir,’ as you have done once or twice, or it will get
about that I am arrogating to myself princely honours. I must ask you
to address me as ‘Count,’ if your instinctive veneration for me
demands the use of some epithet.”
</p>

<p>
The reproof was given so genially that it was impossible to take
offence, and Mansfield, who had grown very red, returned gradually to
his normal colour, and translated the paragraph with very fair
fluency:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“The London ‘Fleet Street Gazette’ publishes a telegram from its
correspondent in Czarigrad which exposes a deep-laid conspiracy on the
part of the Jews to possess themselves of Palestine. A concession is
on the point of being obtained from the Grand Seignior which
authorises the development of the whole country by a Hebrew syndicate,
and its colonisation by Jewish immigrants. The intermediary at
Czarigrad is understood to have been the Englishman Mortimer, of
Thracian notoriety.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
Mansfield’s voice dropped when he came to the last word, and he
glanced fearfully at Cyril, expecting to find him pained, possibly
indignant; but seeing that he was smoking placidly, he took heart of
grace.
</p>

<p>
“I expected this. Are you a thin-skinned person, Mansfield?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t think so&mdash;I really don’t know,” stammered Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“I mean, can you stand being generally cold-shouldered, if not
actually cut? Do you yearn for constant communion with your kind?”
</p>

<p>
“I suppose I could stand being sent to Coventry without whining. Is
that the sort of thing?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly. If I am not mistaken, that is the fate which will be meted
out to you and me for the next few days. If your spirits are liable to
give way under it, you had better go home at once.”
</p>

<p>
“Count!” There was no mistaking the chagrin in the young man’s tone,
and Cyril laughed encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
“That’s all right. I only wanted to prepare you for the worst. Well,
shall we take a little stroll? If you are anxious to put my powers of
prophecy to the proof, we might pay a few visits.”
</p>

<p>
The prospect of being turned from the doors of the persons visited did
not commend itself to Mansfield, however, and Cyril and he strolled
across the bridge and into the tree-shaded Neue Wiese or promenade.
The stern regulations in vogue at Ludwigsbad permit an afternoon walk,
but do not enforce it, and the gardens and the Königspark were not
therefore crowded with <i>Kurgäste</i>, as would be the case a little
later n the day. Still, there were a fair number of restless sufferers
endeavouring to satisfy their consciences by a feverish activity in
lounging up and down, or taking duty drives to points of interest, in
company with the faithful relations who had attended them into exile,
and Mansfield watched with a painful attention their demeanour towards
his employer. He himself had arrived only the day before, and Cyril
had carried him off almost immediately to an informal dinner-party at
an open-air restaurant, where a little knot of men bearing historic
names, and of women famous all over Europe for their beauty, had
laughed and talked and jested, as they discussed the unappetising fare
allowed them, like members of a very happy, simple-hearted, and united
family. The novelty of the occasion had a little intoxicated him, and
when the party broke up at nine o’clock it had needed a brisk walk
along the Charlottenbad road, and an indulgence in thoughts of
Philippa, such as he rarely allowed himself, to enable him to sleep at
all. The unexpected friendliness of these great people had been
astonishing enough, but it would be nothing compared with a sudden
change to coolness, such as Cyril seemed to anticipate. Just as
Mansfield, in his thoughts, had reached this point, he saw a carriage
approaching in which sat the loveliest and friendliest of the ladies
of the evening before. The Countess von Hohenthurm was a celebrated
Pannonian beauty, and was commonly considered the haughtiest woman in
the empire; but she had taken Mansfield under her wing at the
dinner-party, explaining the half-veiled personal allusions with which
the conversation was largely sprinkled, and confiding to him various
indiscreet revelations respecting notable people then staying or
expected at the baths. As she came towards him now, Mansfield raised
his hand instinctively towards his hat, but Cyril’s voice at his side
said, “Wait. It is possible that the lady has not the pleasure of your
acquaintance.”
</p>

<p>
The idea seemed preposterous, for the Countess, in response to some
remark made by the elderly lady who was driving with her, had turned
her head in the direction of the two Englishmen, but there was no
glance of recognition as her eyes met theirs. Without the movement of
a muscle or the slightest change of colour, she looked through them
both at the trees behind. It was beyond question that in the world of
the Countess von Hohenthurm there existed no such persons as Count
Mortimer and his secretary.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t look so utterly crushed,” said Cyril, giving Mansfield’s arm a
gentle shake. “Didn’t I tell you how it would be?”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield walked on in silence, with compressed lips. Presently they
met two of the gentlemen with whom they had dined, but these were so
deeply engrossed in conversation as to be unable to recognise them.
Next they passed a rustic seat, behind which rose a rock bearing an
inscription to the effect that the Archduke Ferdinand Joachim desired
to testify to the benefit he had derived from a course of the
Ludwigsbad waters. Here there sat a hideous elderly man, of generous
proportions, who was laying down the laws of fashion to two or three
admiring disciples, with all the confidence to be expected in the
recognised arbiter of taste at the baths. He also had been one of the
guests of the night before, and Mansfield had conceived an instinctive
dislike to him&mdash;a dislike which was not now lessened by his putting up
an eyeglass, and wondering audibly, in terms of unnecessary emphasis,
“Who those fellows might be that looked like Englishmen?”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” said Cyril, as they passed on; “was I a true prophet?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; oh yes. But why&mdash;what does it all mean?”
</p>

<p>
“It means that they believe, or pretend to believe, that we are
leagued with the Jews against them, and therefore, very naturally,
they feel obliged to mark their disapproval of us.”
</p>

<p>
“But will it go on? How long will they keep it up?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh yes, it will go on, for exactly three days and a half. Remember
that. Until then, I fear that you and I shall be confined to each
other’s society. Pray talk as much as you like. I shall be delighted
to listen.”
</p>

<p>
“I should like to say a word or two to that fellow,” muttered
Mansfield, indicating by a backward glance the oracle of fashion.
</p>

<p>
“I earnestly hope you won’t. In the first place, he would not
understand your German, and your righteous indignation would therefore
be wasted. In the next, I would rather not kill him if I can help it.”
</p>

<p>
“Kill him? how?”
</p>

<p>
“With a sword, my dear youth. Excuse me, but you are really so
refreshingly young. Is it beyond your powers of imagination to
conceive that if you insulted him he would forthwith challenge me?”
</p>

<p>
“I can look after my own quarrels, Count,” very haughtily.
</p>

<p>
“In that case I should very soon have a funeral to look after in the
British cemetery,” was the calm reply. “The man is a noted duellist,
and you would be at his mercy in two minutes. With me as his
antagonist, I will be conceited enough to say, things would be
reversed. Since you are so kind as to propose to quarrel with him on
my account, perhaps I may be allowed to intimate that I prefer a
living secretary to a dead one.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield, with an embarrassed laugh, yielded the point, although he
did not succeed in arriving all at once at his employer’s pitch of
philosophy. As they walked on, Cyril amused himself by detecting and
commenting upon the shifts to which his acquaintances were reduced in
order to escape seeing him. The ostracism was complete, and he pointed
out to Mansfield that it must have been decreed only that
morning&mdash;probably as soon as the Vindobona papers arrived. It so
happened that there were no royal personages at the baths at present;
but among the sojourners there was a large contingent of the Pannonian
nobility, and it was from these, doubtless, that the fiat had gone
forth which declared Count Mortimer to be from henceforth beyond the
pale of society. A determined enemy, or even a mere busybody, could
easily have found means to promulgate the news during those hours of
the morning which were supposed to be devoted to rest, when authority
had once spoken. It proved that no one was sufficiently courageous to
disobey the edict but the officials of the place, who themselves
saluted Cyril with an expression which said that this courtesy was not
a reflection of their personal feelings, and that their sympathies
were with his opponents. Matters were not improved on the arrival of
the English papers, for it was discovered that the Vindobona journal
which had done all the mischief had omitted one item of special
interest in its quotation from the ‘Fleet Street Gazette.’ “The sudden
collapse of the Hercynian opposition to Count Mortimer’s scheme,”
wrote the correspondent at Czarigrad, “is thought here to be the
result of the kind of business arrangement vulgarly known as a ‘deal.’
In other words, the Imperial Government has been bought off.” This was
enough. The hatred always smouldering between the two Teutonic empires
burst forth once more in the breasts of their representatives at
Ludwigsbad, and the few Hercynians at the baths found themselves
shunned almost as completely as Cyril, with whom their own convictions
effectually forbade them to fraternise.
</p>


<h3 id="ch03">
CHAPTER III.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">IN SILVER SLIPPERS.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">During</span> the three days and a half anticipated by Cyril, he and his
secretary remained under a ban, and moved about among the crowds of
<i>Kurgäste</i> as little noticed as if they had been two invisible men,
and almost as freely as if they had had Ludwigsbad to themselves. They
were apparently unseen when, with their Bohemian glass tumblers
suspended from their buttonholes, they joined the shivering throngs
that surround in the early morning the kiosks from which the horrible
healing waters are dispensed, and partook of their respective
draughts, Cyril taking the proper eight glasses and Mansfield only
one, purely for the sake of sociability. In the promenade which
followed they met no one who was conscious of ever having seen them
before; and when they had bought the regulation rolls and sat down to
drink their coffee at a little table surrounded by scores of others,
they were not only alone but unperceived in the crowd. In the
afternoon they paid no visits and received none; and at dinner-time,
when merry parties were formed round all the restaurant-tables, they
sat down alone save for the company of the taciturn Thracian secretary
Paschics, who seemed to be given over to perpetual mourning for the
high position his employer had once held and lost. Not that their
isolated condition made their table less gay than the rest. Cyril,
always debonnaire and cheerful, exerted himself determinedly on these
occasions to bring a smile to the melancholy countenance of Paschics,
with the result that Mansfield became almost exhausted with laughing.
The waiters hovered attentively in their neighbourhood, eager to catch
a stray joke; and even the Kurdirektor, a very high and mighty
autocrat indeed, found himself tempted by the peals of laughter to
smoke a cigarette and partake of dessert in company with these victims
of popular disapproval. One evening there was a dance after dinner at
the Kursaal, and Cyril and Mansfield strolled in among the spectators,
enjoying hugely the promptness with which way was made for them, as
though they had been royal personages, or surrounded by an invisible
but tangible fence. That is to say, Cyril enjoyed the experience
frankly for its own sake, and Mansfield because he reflected that it
was in Cyril’s cause he was undergoing it. Two years of fairly
constant intercourse with Lady Philippa Mortimer had not tended to
diminish his early veneration for her adored uncle, and there was also
the further consolation for such hardship as his lot involved that she
would regard it with sympathy&mdash;even with admiration.
</p>

<p>
The evenings on which there was no dancing were equally amusing in
their way. Wandering through the shrubberies of the Königspark in the
summer twilight, Cyril found himself accosted in sheltered corners
first by one man and then by another who did not dare to dispute the
general edict in public, but thought it might be advisable to remain
friends with both sides under the rose. Naturally these people were
not of the class or character with whom friendship was most desirable,
being chiefly gentlemen who lived by their wits, with a sprinkling of
Jews who believed that the Chevalier Goldberg had bought Cyril for
their nation, and that this justified them in claiming his services
for themselves, and it was a never-ending amusement to Mansfield to
observe the adroitness with which Cyril snubbed them and dropped them
promptly back into their proper places. There was one elderly
capitalist who seemed to have been mildly coerced by the Chevalier
into giving in his adhesion to the national movement, for on three
separate occasions he pursued Cyril with a mournful persistence,
endeavouring to persuade him that, since the masters of money
throughout Europe were now for once united, it was folly to waste the
force of such a combination on the mere acquisition of Palestine, when
it might be used to establish a universal empire on a financial basis.
The contrast between the frail, cringing figure of the old man, and
his world-embracing schemes, was sufficiently ludicrous; but he stuck
to his point until Cyril asked him what the hapless Jews scattered
throughout Europe, on whom the popular fury would at once fall in case
his plan was attempted, would think of him. Then he wrung his hands
and made as though to rend his clothes, and departed sorrowful.
</p>

<p>
The three days mentioned by Cyril as the duration of the ostracism had
elapsed; but when the usual visit to the springs was paid on the
fourth morning, Mansfield noticed no change in the demeanour of the
<i>Kurgäste</i>. People still looked over, round, and through the two
Englishmen, and avoided carefully coming into the slightest personal
contact with them as they stood waiting their turn to receive the hot
and loathsome beverage. But when the unpleasant duty had been
performed, and the drinkers turned away from the kiosk and into the
promenade, the event occurred which Cyril had foreseen. Approaching
the spring was a tall grey-bearded man of military appearance, walking
with two others, who maintained their position a step behind him on
either side, and to whom he turned and spoke occasionally. In the
foreground, ranged in two lines and leaving an ample path for the
new-comer, were all the most aristocratic of the Ludwigsbad visitors,
bowing and curtseying with the deepest reverence as he reached them,
and manifestly overjoyed when they received a personal greeting.
</p>

<p>
“The Emperor of Pannonia,” whispered Cyril to Mansfield. “Watch!”
</p>

<p>
How it happened Mansfield did not clearly see, since he was doing his
best to copy the elaborate bows of the Pannonian magnates, but he was
aware that the Emperor caught sight of Cyril, beckoned him forward,
greeted him warmly, and requested him to turn and walk with him a
short distance. Standing rather in the background, Mansfield was able
to perceive and appreciate the expressions of astonishment and chagrin
which chased one another over the countenances of the crowd that
attended the Emperor, but he had little time to reflect upon their
discomfiture, for a sign from Cyril warned him to fall into line with
the two equerries, so that he could no longer observe the results of
the Imperial condescension on the Emperor’s subjects. As for Cyril, he
knew the reason of this friendly address, and had anticipated it. A
Court scandal of a peculiarly unpleasant character had just been
averted by means of the ready help of the Chevalier Goldberg. Not for
the first time an archducal household had been established with the
aid of the Chevalier’s money, and a secret threatening the honour of
the Imperial house and the happiness of a young bride was safely
locked up in the Chevalier’s breast. The Emperor was duly grateful,
and having been informed of the connection between the Chevalier and
Cyril, was doing honour to the one man by way of gratifying the other.
He had, moreover, something to say also to Cyril himself.
</p>

<p>
“This Palestine scheme of yours, Count&mdash;I am glad to have the
opportunity of speaking to you about it. Is there any prospect of your
being successful?”
</p>

<p>
“I see no insuperable difficulty in our way at present, sir.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I only hope you may succeed&mdash;as far as possible, that is&mdash;for
there is no chance of getting rid of the whole body of Jews. The fewer
that remain in Europe the more business will there be for those few,
and I should fear that the emigrants will all come flocking back when
they see how things are going. Still, you may relieve us of the lowest
class of Jew for a time, at any rate, and that will do something to
simplify our heart-breaking problems here. But before I can commend
your scheme unreservedly, Count, I must be satisfied on one point of
the utmost importance. You are aware that I number among my titles
that of King of Jerusalem, and that two at least of my brother
monarchs claim the right to do the same. We are hereditary guardians
of the Holy Places, and you must see that it would not only be
abhorrent to ourselves personally, but absolutely impossible, in view
of the sentiment of Christendom, to place them in the power of the
Jews.”
</p>

<p>
“That has been clearly foreseen, sir. It was the intention of the
board whom I represent to request the Powers to nominate a Christian
governor, who should make the Holy Places his chief care.”
</p>

<p>
“You make no suggestion as to the person to be nominated, Count?” The
Emperor turned a keen glance upon Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“None, sir. It is obvious that the Prince to be chosen must be a man
of liberal views, or he would fail to obtain the suffrages of all the
Powers, but that is the only suggestion we could venture to offer. I
suppose the governor would maintain order, as at present, by the aid
of a Moslem guard; but it would be necessary to allow the Jews free
access to the spots which they consider holy, and which they are now
debarred from approaching. That proviso can hardly fail to commend
itself to your Majesty as fair, I think?”
</p>

<p>
“It is only natural, and would affect no one but the Roumis, I
imagine. Well, Count, you have relieved my mind. It will not surprise
you to hear that urgent representations against your scheme have been
made to me from several quarters, and without this very equitable
proposal of yours I should have been forced to fall in with the views
they expressed. Now, however, I am able to say that in my opinion you
offer adequate protection for Christianity and the Holy Places, and I
shall act accordingly. You are taking the waters here, I believe? I am
glad to know you are at hand, in case I wish to consult you again on
this subject.”
</p>

<p>
Thus graciously dismissed, Cyril mingled again with the crowd&mdash;a crowd
that was now as anxious to propitiate as it had hitherto been to
ignore him. During the next five minutes, three men, one of whom was
the arbiter of fashion, asked him to dinner that night, and the
Countess von Hohenthurm vouchsafed him the honour of carrying the
paper bag containing her breakfast-roll. Tactless people complained of
their bad eyesight, or lamented that they had not heard Count Mortimer
was at the baths until this morning, but the tactful simply took up
their acquaintance with him at the point where they had dropped it
three days before. Cyril met their overtures in the same spirit, and
his sole piece of revenge was to tell his entertainers at breakfast
all the news of the last three days, as though they had only just
arrived&mdash;a piece of pleasantry which brought to Mansfield’s face a
passing gleam of satisfaction. Cyril took him to task for his lowering
brow as they returned to the hotel, and told him that when the
Countess von Hohenthurm was so condescending as to show an interest in
a young man, it behoved that young man to be grateful, and to look it.
</p>

<p>
“They are all a set of sycophants!” returned Mansfield sharply. “How
you can make friends of them again, I can’t imagine.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t make friends of them, but they are fellow-members of society,
and it would serve no good purpose to quarrel with them. If I was in
their place, I should have acted precisely as they have done.”
</p>

<p>
“You won’t get me to believe that!” said Mansfield, with an air of
mild reproof which Cyril found irresistibly comic.
</p>

<p>
“Why, how would you have had me mark my sense of their behaviour?” he
asked.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t see how you can meet them again with any cordiality. Why not
decline the honour of their further acquaintance?”
</p>

<p>
“Because we live in the great world, and not in Arcadia. You young
people brought up virtuously in England have something terribly stagey
about you. You are all for great <i>coups</i>, but that sort of thing
doesn’t do in ordinary life. You remind me very much of my brother
Caerleon as a young fellow. I don’t think I was ever so ineffably
young myself. I hope not, at any rate. Melodrama is not good form.”
</p>

<p>
Much crushed by these remarks, which he received as a rebuke,
Mansfield remained silent, and Cyril, observing this, administered a
restorative as they entered the hotel.
</p>

<p>
“Never mind. I prefer you as you are. A little melodrama in private is
rather amusing than otherwise, and in society you are a model of
discretion, except as regards your looks. Those you must learn to
control a little, but don’t think that I want you not to tell me what
you think.”
</p>

<p>
He spoke rather absently, for the post had come in while they were
out, and the table in his room was covered with letters and
newspapers. He began at once to open the letters, while Mansfield
turned to the papers and began his daily task of looking through them
in search of any reference to the United Nation scheme.
</p>

<p>
“There is a very hostile article in this Scythian paper, Count,” he
said after a time, looking round.
</p>

<p>
“Ah! what paper?”
</p>

<p>
“The ‘Pavelsburg Gazette.’”
</p>

<p>
“Good! then it’s inspired. Give me a rough translation, please.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield was now accustomed to requests of this kind, and went
through the article as rapidly as his somewhat imperfect knowledge of
Scythian permitted. The writer was absolutely appalled by the news
which had come from Czarigrad by way of England, and called upon all
Christians to rise and prevent the proposed transfer of Palestine to
Jewish hands. So sacrilegious an outrage could not be allowed to
proceed, and it was the glorious privilege of the Emperor of Scythia,
as head of the Orthodox Church and protector of the Holy Places, to
prevent it. There was not a Scythian that would not give his life
freely in such a cause, and the sooner the necessary steps were taken
the better. It might be well even to proclaim a crusade, and end the
Jewish difficulty at one blow by sweeping the whole of the accursed
race from the earth.
</p>

<p>
“Very pretty!” said Cyril, “and evidently meant to prepare the way for
effective action. Scythia has already sounded the other Powers, no
doubt; I thought as much from what the Emperor said to me just now.
Well, I have put a spoke in her wheel, I fancy. When she finds there
is nothing to be done in that direction, she will proceed to push
matters to extremities at Czarigrad, and then comes the tug of war.”
</p>

<p>
“But can you hope to put sufficient backbone into the Grand Seignior
to enable Roum to stand up against her?” asked Mansfield, surprised by
the confident tone.
</p>

<p>
“No, that would be beyond the wit of man, but I intend to put a little
gentle pressure on Scythia instead.”
</p>

<p>
“Would it spoil your plans if you told me how you intend to do it? I
can’t imagine how you will manage.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled pleasantly. “There is a famine in Scythia at this
moment,” he said; “so much you know already. You know also that it
must be pretty bad for the Scythian papers to be allowed to
acknowledge its existence at all. There is also a rising in Central
Asia that looks threatening. The sufferers from the famine must be
helped, and the rising must be put down, but where is the money to
come from? Such hoards as the peasantry may have amassed in good years
are exhausted by this time, and there are no Jews left in the rural
districts to borrow from. The Government will have to step in, but
though the war-chest is full, its contents must be kept intact in view
of a possible European war, and there is very little money in the
country otherwise. To improve matters, certain shrewd gentlemen in
America have arranged a corner in cereals, with a special eye to this
famine and the consequent demand. Now do you see where we come in,
when it becomes evident that there is no money to be obtained in all
Europe if our scheme is thwarted at Czarigrad?”
</p>

<p>
“You mean to starve them out?” said Mansfield, with more than a touch
of horror in his tone.
</p>

<p>
“By no means. We take our pound of flesh, which is Palestine, that’s
all.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
“What a queer-looking old chap that is over there, Count!” said
Mansfield to Cyril, as they were taking their walk one morning about a
week after the Emperor’s arrival. “He might be a stage brigand.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril glanced in the direction he indicated. “Why, that is my
venerable friend Prince Mirkovics!” he cried. “Who would ever have
dreamt of meeting him here? I thought he never left Thracia.”
</p>

<p>
He crossed the promenade with a rapid step, and accosted the old man
whose truculent air and fierce white moustache had attracted
Mansfield’s attention. The garb of civilisation sat awkwardly upon
Prince Mirkovics, and it was obvious that he felt ill at ease without
the pistols and dagger which adorned his girdle when in Thracian
costume; but the scornful frown with which he had been contemplating
the vanities of Ludwigsbad vanished when he caught sight of Cyril,
whom he greeted with beaming smiles.
</p>

<p>
“I will join you in your walk, Count, if you will allow me,” he said,
when Mansfield had been duly introduced to him. “I have a good deal to
tell you.”
</p>

<p>
“Two years’ Thracian news!” said Cyril lightly. “I have avoided
hearing or reading anything of the kind, on principle, since I left
Thracia, but I felt all the time that it was only accumulating, to
overwhelm me some day.”
</p>

<p>
“His Excellency loves to jest,” remarked Prince Mirkovics solemnly to
Mansfield. “Perhaps,” he added, turning again to Cyril, “you are not
even aware that his Majesty intends to visit Ludwigsbad? I believe he
was to arrive to-day.”
</p>

<p>
“What, King Michael?” cried Cyril. “No, I had not heard it. Why, Mr
Mansfield, how is this? It’s your business to keep me posted up in the
names of the expected arrivals. Oh, is that it?” as Mansfield began a
stammering defence; “you thought it might call up unpleasant memories,
and therefore you left me to meet him unawares? I am not quite so
sensitive as that, you know, and you needn’t be so very anxious to
spare my feelings.”
</p>

<p>
“The Princess of Dardania is naturally coming as well,” continued
Prince Mirkovics.
</p>

<p>
“Surely not? Why, her husband has only been dead for ten or twelve
months. She is far too clever to outrage propriety by coming to such a
place as this so soon.”
</p>

<p>
“She does not dare to stay away, Count. The quarrel with her eldest
son has forced her to quit Dardania, and the coolness which came to a
head before that between herself and her elder daughter closes Mœsia
to her. Thracia is her only hope, for if King Michael should break his
promise to marry the Princess Ludmilla, she would be discredited on
all sides.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril’s eyes flashed ominously. “Then her Nemesis has overtaken her
already?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“It has, Count, at least so far as regards the marriage project which
threw you out of office. Her Royal Highness is a clever woman, but she
has so much at stake in this affair that she has failed to show her
customary tact. She has kept too tight a hand over young Michael, made
the chain by which she has bound him to her daughter too evident, and
if he could muster sufficient courage, he would break it. He slipped
away from Thracia without her knowledge, well aware that she would
oppose his coming here, and she, her daughter, and her household, are
following him promptly. But everything will be done with propriety, my
dear Count. She has borrowed the Grand-Duke Eugen’s villa, and will
receive none but relations.”
</p>

<p>
“Still, the proceeding sounds a little undignified,” said Cyril drily.
</p>

<p>
“So much the better, Count, provided it fails. That woman is the curse
of Thracia. Since you left us she has filled the Ministry, the army,
and the civil service with Scythian sympathisers&mdash;for Drakovics, in
his second childhood, is nothing but her tool&mdash;with the result that we
are now bankrupt in all but name.”
</p>

<p>
“Bankrupt? and I left the treasury full!”
</p>

<p>
“Bankrupt. Such changes cost money, Count, both for rewarding friends
and bribing foes. The King, again&mdash;he is a young gentleman of taste,
and must spend liberally on his pleasures. The increase of the
army&mdash;we could approve of that, for he is Otto Georg’s son, and should
be a born soldier. The beautifying of the capital and the construction
of needless public works&mdash;well, it provides employment for the
proletariat, and no doubt he has inherited his mother’s charitable
disposition. But when it comes to squandering money upon theatres and
pictures, and subsidising musicians and dubious foreigners of all
sorts&mdash;then, Count, we remember that he is the grandson of Luitpold of
Weldart, and we tremble.”
</p>

<p>
“And does the Princess approve of these artistic pleasures?”
</p>

<p>
“By no means, Count; but she cannot persuade his Majesty to relinquish
them, and since his mother left Thracia there is no one else who can
even pretend to influence him.”
</p>

<p>
“But what a shameful thing for the Queen to leave Thracia when she had
allowed her son to bring all this trouble upon the kingdom!” broke in
Mansfield, who had imbibed from Lady Philippa an inveterate dislike of
the woman whom she regarded as her uncle’s evil genius. “What has she
done with herself?”
</p>

<p>
“Young man,” said Prince Mirkovics severely, “her Majesty was deeply
affected by the unhappy events which drove Count Mortimer from
Thracia. Her uncontrollable grief reflected so severely upon her son
and the Princess of Dardania, that they proposed to place her in
seclusion, alleging that she suffered from delusions. Warned in time,
the Queen succeeded in escaping from the kingdom, accompanied by
several faithful members of her household. From Czarigrad, where she
took refuge, she made terms with her son, who agreed to pay her
jointure without protest if she withdrew altogether from politics in
future. Her Majesty then retired to a community of Protestant nuns on
Mount Lebanon, where she occupies herself in good works and in
bewailing the past. My daughter is one of those who share her exile,
gladly devoting their lives to the service of their unfortunate
mistress. Count Mortimer knows that I disliked the Queen’s being
appointed regent, but nothing can excuse King Michael’s conduct to his
mother.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril had remained silent while Prince Mirkovics spoke. His face was
very pale, and it was with evident difficulty that he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Have you no remedy to propose for the state of things in Thracia,
Prince?”
</p>

<p>
“I have; but it is a drastic one. You wonder, perhaps, to see me here?
Do you know that I am on my way home from England&mdash;I who have never
left Thracia before? I visited your brother, to inquire whether there
was any hope of his returning to the throne in this extremity.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Prince!”
</p>

<p>
“How are we better off than when we were under the house of Franza,
Count? Your brother came to our help then, but he refuses now.”
</p>

<p>
“And quite right, too. Accepting the offer of a vacant throne is a
very different thing from annexing an occupied one.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, we turn to you. Will you return to Thracia as Prime
Minister? The country is on our side, and we propose to set before the
King the alternatives of accepting you as Premier or as Regent. The
Constitution makes provision for such an appointment in case of the
incurable extravagance or deliberate viciousness of the monarch.”
</p>

<p>
“Pray speak lower, Prince. You are talking treason, and in Ludwigsbad
the very rocks have ears. No; I cannot come. I have other work on
hand.”
</p>

<p>
“You are doing something for the Jews. Oh, throw them over.”
</p>

<p>
“Not in favour of Thracia, at any rate. Thracia had me once, and
resigned me with quite unnecessary willingness. Now she may want me,
but she can’t have me. The punishment is deserved.”
</p>

<p>
“But for our sakes, Count&mdash;your friends?”
</p>

<p>
“No, Prince, I am not up to it. I gave the best part of my life to
building up a workable and fairly honest system of government, and two
years have been enough to reduce it to chaos. I could not submit to
the years of weary office drudgery over again. New work I can take up
and carry through; but I have lost the patience and elasticity I used
to possess, and I will not fail where I succeeded once.”
</p>

CHAPTER IV.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">A DISTURBING ELEMENT.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> bitter words in which Cyril renounced all interest in Thracia
were interrupted by an exclamation from Mansfield, who was staring
incredulously at a little party of people approaching from one of the
winding paths. There were an old lady in a bath-chair, a girl, and a
young man, the last two unmistakably English.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you see, Count? It’s Lady Phil and Usk!” cried Mansfield,
quickening his steps; but Cyril caught him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
“Wait a minute, Mansfield. Did my brother stipulate that you were not
to speak to Lady Phil during this year of probation? If he did, I will
curb my natural longing to see my niece, and we will turn our backs
upon danger.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, really!” Mansfield was horror-struck by the suggestion. “I
was not to follow her about; but I was never forbidden to speak to her
if we met. Lord Caerleon trusted me, I am sure.”
</p>

<p>
“Caerleon was always trustful,” said Cyril unkindly; but he consented
to keep pace with Mansfield’s hurrying feet, and was considerate
enough to allow the young people to greet one another apart, while he
presented Prince Mirkovics in due form to Princess Soudaroff, an
exiled Scythian lady who occupied the position of godmother to both
the Marchioness of Caerleon and her daughter. Had the matter rested
with him, he would have left them to themselves for a longer time, but
Prince Mirkovics, who was standing with his hat in his hand, looked at
him reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
“Alas, Count! am I not to enjoy the honour of being presented also to
Madame your niece?”
</p>

<p>
“Prince Mirkovics accords you royal honours, Phil,” said Cyril. “Is it
necessary to mention that Lady Philippa is Lord Caerleon’s daughter,
Prince?”
</p>

<p>
“Quite unnecessary, Count. Madame must not come to Thracia unless she
comes as queen. There are still old men who remember her father’s
reign, and it goes without saying that all the young men would be
ready to champion the cause of such a lady.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m so glad you think me like my father,” said Philippa, in her old
impulsive way. “But even if he was still King of Thracia, I shouldn’t
be of any importance, you know. Usk would be the great person, not I.”
</p>

<p>
Prince Mirkovics glanced at the slight dark-haired youth whose
mirthful grey eyes met his across the bath-chair, and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
“No, madame, Milord Usk resembles your mother too much. She was a
beautiful girl, indeed&mdash;I remember seeing her at the municipal ball
given in honour of your father’s arrival at Bellaviste&mdash;but to us she
is only the woman for whose sake Carlino forsook Thracia.”
</p>

<p>
“What a horrid way of putting it!” cried Philippa. “You ought to be
thankful that I’m not a princess, for I should get you banished from
Court for saying such things. Uncle Cyril, I am sure we ought not to
keep Prince Mirkovics standing here so long.”
</p>

<p>
She glanced entreatingly at her uncle, for Prince Mirkovics still
maintained his deferential attitude, hat in hand, and Cyril came to
the rescue. “My niece is afraid you will take cold, Prince. Pray put
on your hat.”
</p>

<p>
“May I be permitted to attend Madame for a short distance?” asked the
old man, complying immediately with the request, and Cyril, much
amused, accepted the humbler office of walking beside the bath-chair,
while Mansfield, looking extremely disconsolate, attached himself to
Usk.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Princess, this is your doing!” said Cyril to the old lady. “You
are certainly an inveterate match-maker. I never knew any one like
you.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, what have I done?” asked Princess Soudaroff, with great
simplicity. “I thought the Ludwigsbad waters might do me good, and
therefore I came here. Could I leave Phil and her brother behind, when
their parents had entrusted them to my care?”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps you had heard that the Ludwigsbad water is meat and drink in
one, and thought you might economise, eh, Princess? Have you been
spending your whole year’s income in advance on your charities, as
usual?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no. The fact is, poor Phil seemed so painfully interested in
Ludwigsbad and your letters, that I thought the waters would&mdash;would do
me no harm, and so we are here.”
</p>

<p>
“The truth at last, Princess! Confession is good for the soul.”
</p>

<p>
“I like the look of the young man,” remarked the Princess
confidentially. “Of course I have heard a great deal about him already
from Usk, but I was anxious to see him. And he is your secretary, Lord
Cyril? And you are engaged in bringing about the restoration of the
Jews to their own land? What a wonderful age this is of ours, and what
a privilege for you to be allowed to assist in such a work! I can’t
tell you how thankful it makes me that I have been allowed to live
long enough to witness this crowning fulfilment of prophecy.”
</p>

<p>
“I must introduce my friend Goldberg to you if he comes here,” said
Cyril. “You and he both take that view of things.”
</p>

<p>
“I have already had some correspondence with the Chevalier Goldberg on
the subject of relief for the Scythian Jews. Ah, how sad it is that my
own country should take the lead in ill-treating God’s ancient people!
Is it true that Scythia is even now resisting your measures for
releasing them from bondage?”
</p>

<p>
“Scythia is undoubtedly doing her best to spoil our plans at
Czarigrad.”
</p>

<p>
“Lord Cyril, a thought has struck me.” The old lady sat upright
suddenly. “I am expecting Vladimir Alexandrovitch here in a day or
two. You know that he manages my affairs, and is anxious to consult me
about some investment. When I told him I should be at Ludwigsbad, he
said that would suit him quite well.”
</p>

<p>
“Prince Soudaroff is coming here?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, merely on this business of mine, as I said. But he is an
honourable, fair-minded man. Why should you not meet him informally
and talk things over? You could put the case for the Jews fully before
him&mdash;men in his position are always surrounded by people whose
interest it is to keep the truth from them&mdash;and I am sure he would be
convinced. Then he could represent the real state of affairs to the
Emperor. You won’t refuse to make the attempt? It may save so much
delay.”
</p>

<p>
“I shall be delighted to meet Prince Soudaroff whenever you like,
Princess.” But in his own mind Cyril was using very different language
regarding the prospective visit of the great diplomatist who was so
fortunate as to be brother-in-law to the unsuspicious old lady in the
bath-chair.
</p>

<p>
“Then they have felt the pinch already? This is sharp work. Wily idea
to cloak the object of Soudaroff’s journey in this way. But I shall
have to walk warily, for it’s no joke to find oneself between him and
her most sapient Highness of Dardania.”
</p>

<p>
They had arrived at the bridge between the old and new promenades, and
he seized the opportunity to detach Prince Mirkovics from Philippa,
and carry him off to his rooms, earning Mansfield’s undying gratitude
by deputing him to escort the ladies back to their lodgings&mdash;a
gratitude which was immediately extended to the Princess when she
remarked that it would be pleasant to take a turn in the Neue Wiese
before returning.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know,” said Philippa mysteriously, as she resumed her place
beside the chair, while Mansfield unblushingly deserted Usk in order
to walk with her, “I think that poor old man must be a little queer.
He has been going on in the most extraordinary way, saying that I
ought to be a queen, and trying to make me discontented with my humble
lot in life. I told him I was perfectly happy in it, and then he said
that I had inherited my father’s only fault, lack of ambition, and
that if father and Uncle Cyril could be mixed up together, they would
make a perfect king. I told him that I thought Uncle Cyril was
splendid, but that I wouldn’t have father the least bit different for
anything, and he said that only confirmed what he had remarked
before.”
</p>

<p>
“He evidently thinks it’s your duty to worry father back to Thracia,”
laughed Usk.
</p>

<p>
“Awfully lucky for me that you don’t agree with him,” said Mansfield.
“I should never have had a chance of coming across you in that case.”
</p>

<p>
“And if you had,” said Usk, “it wouldn’t have done you much good. Do
you think her Royal Highness the Princess Philippa would have
condescended to be aware of your existence?”
</p>

<p>
“Usk! as if I should ever forget old friends, or pretend to make any
difference with them!” cried Philippa indignantly.
</p>

<p>
“I am sure you never would,” said Mansfield, so fervently that Usk
laughed aloud, and Princess Soudaroff smiled a placid smile. They had
now reached the Königspark, and were passing one of the outlying
restaurants with which it is dotted. Before the door stood three dusty
travelling-carriages loaded with luggage. The drivers were refreshing
themselves after the not very lengthy journey from Charlottenbad, and
a number of servants, swaggering about, were displaying their liveries
before the admiring eyes of the waitresses. As Princess Soudaroff and
her companions passed on, they came in sight of a group of rather
noisy young men, who were gathered round a table on a terrace
overlooking the river, apparently recruiting their exhausted energies
with the help of beverages not exactly of a temperance character. One
of the drinkers, who sat by himself on one side of the table, made a
remark to the rest, and the whole party turned round and stared at
Philippa. The blush called up on her cheek by the fervour of
Mansfield’s remark changed into a flush of anger when she became aware
of their rudeness, and she held her golden head very high as she
addressed a studiously careless observation to Usk, but her
displeasure appeared to fail of its intended effect.
</p>

<p>
“<i>A la belle Anglaise</i>!” cried the youth who had already spoken to his
friends, who were now all standing up round the table, and the words
were followed by the crash of broken glass as the goblets were dashed
down after the toast had been drunk.
</p>

<p>
“I say, this is beyond a joke!” cried Usk angrily, but Mansfield
gripped his arm, with a look that said, “We will come back and settle
things when the ladies are gone indoors.” Philippa was too much
discomposed to observe this piece of by-play, finding it necessary to
relieve her feelings by a sweeping denunciation of the manners of
foreigners, in which both the young men heartily agreed with her. When
Mansfield had stigmatised the unknown roisterers as a set of cads, and
Usk had added that they were probably shop-walkers from Vindobona out
for a holiday, she felt better, and made haste to turn the
conversation to more agreeable themes. Before very long, however, a
hurried footstep became audible in the direction from which they had
come, and an officer in undress uniform, catching them up, bowed
profoundly to the Princess and Philippa.
</p>

<p>
“My august master, the King of Thracia, regrets deeply that the
indiscreet remarks of some person in his company annoyed
mademoiselle,” he said, in French. “It will afford his Majesty much
gratification to be permitted to offer his apologies in person later
in the day.”
</p>

<p>
“We are much honoured by his Majesty’s solicitude, monsieur,” replied
Princess Soudaroff promptly, “and neither my god-daughter nor I could
dream of demanding further apologies. Karl, you may go on.”
</p>

<p>
And with a bow that equalled his own in courtliness, the Princess left
the discomfited emissary standing in the road.
</p>

<p>
“It is nothing but a trick to discover where we are staying,” she
remarked to the rest, when they were out of earshot.
</p>

<p>
“I shall have something to say to that youth,” said Usk, jerking his
head in the direction of the distant monarch. “Wretched little
whippersnapper, how can he summon up the cheek to look a Mortimer in
the face?”
</p>

<p>
“No, Usk,” said Philippa earnestly; “you mustn’t say a word to him. It
might get Uncle Cyril into fresh trouble. I suppose if the King is
determined to make our acquaintance, he must; but if he does I shall
let him know what I think of him.”
</p>

<p>
None of the party happened to look round, or they would have perceived
the disconsolate messenger following them at a discreet distance. His
errand of pursuing these strangers to their hotel was not an agreeable
one to him, and he hailed gladly the appearance of Prince Mirkovics,
whose elaborate salutation showed that he was acquainted with them, as
a relief from the necessity. The old noble’s eyes gleamed when he
heard the story.
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I can tell his Majesty who the young lady is,” he said, and
walked on so fast that the officer could hardly keep pace with him or
find breath to tell the King why he had come.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Prince; so you can tell us who it is that we have been
admiring?” said King Michael, lazily erecting a pile of broken
wine-glasses.
</p>

<p>
“The lady, sir, is the daughter of the Marquis Carlino, your august
father’s predecessor on the throne.”
</p>

<p>
“The niece, then, of the excellent Count Mortimer!” said the Scythian
officer who had failed in his errand.
</p>

<p>
“What does that signify, when she has such hair?” demanded King
Michael. “I never saw anything like it. All these German women look
washed-out beside her.”
</p>

<p>
The youthful monarch posed as a connoisseur of female beauty, and his
attendants murmured a respectful acquiescence in his decision. Prince
Mirkovics alone did not seem to have heard it. His sombre eyes were
gleaming again under their shaggy brows.
</p>

<p>
“I am glad your Majesty has enjoyed this one glimpse of the lady,” he
said.
</p>

<p>
“Why do you speak as though I should never see her again, Prince? I
intend to make her acquaintance at the ball to-night, and I’ll bet you
anything you like that she gives me half a dozen dances.”
</p>

<p>
“The lady does not attend public balls, sir.” As he spoke Prince
Mirkovics blessed secretly the strict principles in which Nadia
Caerleon had brought up her daughter.
</p>

<p>
“Not go to balls? Why not?” asked the King, in unaffected
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
“Possibly because her parents do not approve of the class of person
she would meet there, sir,” replied Prince Mirkovics, bestowing a
severe glance upon the would-be lady-killer, who looked offended.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, very well: then I shall command Count Mortimer to present her,
that’s all. I mean to speak to her.”
</p>

<p>
“With what object, sir, if I may venture to ask?”
</p>

<p>
“Because I want to see whether she is as lively as she is handsome, of
course. She ought to have plenty of fun in her, from her face.”
</p>

<p>
“If your Majesty is really desirous of making the lady’s
acquaintance”&mdash;Prince Mirkovics was astonished and delighted by the
sudden development in himself of such powers of diplomacy as he had
never suspected hitherto&mdash;“surely it would be well to say nothing to
Count Mortimer. As I ventured to hint just now, if his Excellency knew
that you, sir, had been graciously pleased to express admiration of
his niece, he would probably remove her at once from Ludwigsbad.”
</p>

<p>
“Hang it! so he would,” said the King peevishly. “It would be just
like him.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps, sir, without mentioning the matter to Count Mortimer, I
might have the honour of making your Majesty acquainted with the lady
at a little entertainment of some sort. A ball, of course, is out of
the question&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“And moreover, their Highnesses the Princess of Dardania and Princess
Ludmilla could not be present,” put in the Scythian officer.
</p>

<p>
The King frowned fiercely at the interrupter. “Their Highnesses have
nothing whatever to do with it,” he said angrily. “I make my own
friends without asking their leave.”
</p>

<p>
“Sir,” said Prince Mirkovics, “allow me to say that Captain Roburoff
is nevertheless in the right. I must be able to invite the Princess
Ludmilla, at any rate, to grace the entertainment by her presence.
Would a party of pleasure to visit some object of interest meet your
Majesty’s wishes?”
</p>

<p>
“Anything, anything!” said the King sulkily. “Arrange it as you like,
Prince; only be sure to let me know in time, so that I may make no
other engagement. And see here, you must look after Princess Lida. I
am not going to dangle after her all day, instead of talking to the
beautiful Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
“I will do my best to arrange everything to your Majesty’s taste,”
said Prince Mirkovics as he retired. Once out of the King’s presence,
a feeling of sick disgust came over the old man as he thought of the
part he had played.
</p>

<p>
“That wretched boy the son of Queen Ernestine!” he muttered. “It is as
well she cannot see him. And I to be plotting to give him Carlino’s
daughter! But that is the very thing. She has spirit and strength of
mind sufficient to save him in spite of himself. And if not&mdash;if he
ventured to slight her, to ill-treat her”&mdash;Prince Mirkovics’s hand
clenched itself involuntarily&mdash;“we would tear him from the throne, and
seat her there alone. I would kill him with my own hands; but it would
be worth a year or two of misery for her to have her reigning in
Thracia.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
After due consultation with his hotel-keeper and with the director of
the baths, Prince Mirkovics sent out that evening the invitations for
his picnic, and resigned himself to wait four whole days before he
could do anything more. During this period, however, King Michael
contrived to steal a march upon him. Cyril, to whom in righteous
indignation Mansfield had borne the news of the King’s extraordinary
behaviour, thought it well to make a point of accompanying Princess
Soudaroff and Philippa in their morning and evening promenades, and on
these occasions his party invariably encountered that of the King. The
first time this happened, King Michael, who had not chosen to receive
Cyril when the latter called at his hotel the day before, stopped and
spoke to him with marked graciousness. The next time, becoming aware,
apparently, that the ex-Premier was not alone, he desired him to
present his relations, and addressed to each of them a few affable
words, delivered with a <i>blasé</i> and venerable air which sat oddly
upon his youthful countenance. This gave him the opportunity of seeing
Philippa in a new character, for the spectacle of the sallow,
weary-eyed boy, who had treated him with so much ingratitude,
patronising her beloved uncle, was almost too much for her, and her
blue eyes sparkled with the indignation which her close-pressed lips
succeeded in restraining. Cyril was not blind to the feelings of
either side, but his only comment on what he saw was to tease Philippa
afterwards about her manners, which he declared to lack the repose
that ought to mark the caste of Vere de Vere.
</p>

<p>
On the evening before Prince Mirkovics’s picnic Cyril and Mansfield
betook themselves to Princess Soudaroff’s rooms to join her
dinner-party, instead of dining as usual in the open air. The only
other visitor present was her brother-in-law, the great Scythian
diplomatist, and it was for his benefit that this formal indoor dinner
had been arranged, in order that the keen eyes of Ludwigsbad might not
observe his conference with Cyril. As soon as the meal was over Usk
gave his arm to the Princess, Mansfield, who had received his orders
beforehand, followed, nothing loth, with Philippa, and the two
statesmen were left to themselves, Cyril bringing his chair to Prince
Soudaroff’s end of the table, and waiting for him to begin to speak. A
curious visitor might have observed that when either man glanced away
the eyes of the other ran searchingly over him, as though to discover
some joint in his armour, but that when the two pairs of eyes met, an
impenetrable veil seemed to be let down to hide the soul behind each.
Prince Soudaroff raised a glass of wine critically to the light as he
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“What are your terms, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“You desire an accommodation, then?”
</p>

<p>
Prince Soudaroff shrugged his shoulders. “What would you have? You
have hedged us in so completely that we must capitulate or starve. I
suppose it is understood that if we withdraw our opposition at
Czarigrad you get us the loan we want on easy terms?”
</p>

<p>
“I regret to say that no money can pass until our concession is
actually granted. Aid in corn you shall have to any reasonable
extent.”
</p>

<p>
“This is ungenerous, Count. Why such distrust of our honour?”
</p>

<p>
“It is a compliment to you, Prince. We must make things safe.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I suppose you rely on cruel necessity to bring us to our knees.
But there is one indispensable condition. The proposed governor of
Palestine must be an Orthodox prince.”
</p>

<p>
“That is not our affair. It is for the Powers to decide.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense, my friend! No one knows better than you how to manage the
Powers. You and your syndicate can impose your will upon them in this
particular as in others. Our honour forbids us to accept anything
else. Our past history, the blood we have shed in the Christian cause
against the infidel&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Let me advise you to write it off as a bad debt, Prince.”
</p>

<p>
“Impossible. I dare not return to Pavelsburg without this
modification. The Emperor is firm. He will risk and lose everything
rather than yield the point.”
</p>

<p>
“Then he must bring the Powers to see it in the same light.”
</p>

<p>
“But that is impossible, I tell you. We have no means of bringing them
to our side. Come, Count, we must have your help. Prince Kazimir of
Dardania is our candidate&mdash;a German on the mother’s side. Europe will
not be irreconcilable. What can we offer you to ensure his election?”
</p>

<p>
“Unfortunately, I can’t think of anything I want,” drawled Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“Money&mdash;when we get it? Titles&mdash;we will make you a prince? Political
power?&mdash;come, we will propose you as High Commissioner of Minoa, and
you can enjoy yourself there to your heart’s content.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, Prince; it’s not big enough.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, if you will not accept anything for yourself, what of your
family? Would you care to see your niece Queen of Thracia? Roburoff
tells me that young Michael is perfectly infatuated with her.”
</p>

<p>
“Unfortunately there is an obstacle, in the shape of the Princess of
Dardania and her daughter.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, the Princess has failed us twice, we need not consider her. One
throws away an untrustworthy tool, you know. As for the girl, we will
find her another husband. Your niece would suit Michael much
better&mdash;keep him well in hand and look the part, too. I have been
studying her closely since I came here. She will never have the
regular beauty of her mother; but her colouring is far more charming,
and&mdash;Englishwoman though she is&mdash;she has not the distressing
woodenness of manner which spoiled the lovely Nadia Mikhailovna in her
younger days. If that girl had been brought up by a woman of the
world, instead of a saintly fanatic like my sister Pauline
Vassilievna, she would have taken Europe by storm. Your niece can
never rival her. But then, as I say, she has dignity and good-humour
and <i>bonhomie</i> such as her mother did not possess. Why, I would advise
my august master to obtain her hand for the Crown Prince, but that I
should despair of making her a convert to Orthodoxy.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril laughed gently. “If my niece wishes to be Queen of Thracia,
Prince, she will attain her object without my help. If she doesn’t,
nothing I could do would have any effect upon her.”
</p>

<p>
“You would return to Thracia as Premier, of course.”
</p>

<p>
“Thanks, but that I have already refused to do.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I fear we can settle nothing,” said Prince Soudaroff, rising
from the table, “since I am forbidden to accept any agreement that
excludes this all-important stipulation. I am returning to Pavelsburg
at once, and I will take his Imperial Majesty’s pleasure on the
subject. Shall we join the ladies? I must make my adieux at once, or I
shall not reach Charlottenbad in time for the train.”
</p>

<p>
But although Prince Soudaroff’s coachman was distinctly ordered, in
the hearing of Cyril and Usk, to take the Charlottenbad road, he did
not do so, nor did the occupant of the carriage appear to feel any
alarm when he found himself being driven exactly in the opposite
direction. The road which the coachman appeared to prefer led into the
hills, and after a drive of about twenty minutes the carriage stopped
at a small door in a park-wall, and Prince Soudaroff alighted. The
door opened at his knock, and he walked briskly along the path that
led from it, guided by a ray of light from a window at some distance
in front. Below this window was a door, which was also opened promptly
by an invisible watcher, and admitted the visitor to a passage in
which was a back staircase. The man-servant who had been stationed at
the door conducted him in perfect silence up the stairs, and through a
small ante-room into a luxurious boudoir, in which was sitting a lady
in trailing garments of black and a cap with a long black veil falling
from it to the ground. She dismissed the servant with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
“Well, what is your news?” she asked imperiously of Prince Soudaroff.
</p>

<p>
“Bad, madame. The Mortimer is incorruptible.”
</p>

<p>
“Then the negotiations are broken off?”
</p>

<p>
“Unfortunately, madame, we cannot afford to do that. The other side
know that they have only to wait, and we must yield.”
</p>

<p>
“He refuses to consent to the election of my son?”
</p>

<p>
“He will not express any preference, madame. The matter is one for the
Powers, he says. You and I know that his personal assent would satisfy
the Emperor, and give us all we want.”
</p>

<p>
“Because it would discredit him with the Jews when it came out?”
</p>

<p>
“Either that, madame, or it would so revolt the Catholic powers that
they would combine to oblige Roum to refuse the concession, and he
would lose his prestige. When the Jews reject him, he cannot sink much
lower. Perhaps Hayti would afford the only possible field for his
powers.”
</p>

<p>
The Princess of Dardania smiled gently at the brutal joke. “Then the
affair resolves itself once more into a personal contest between Count
Mortimer and myself,” she said. “You will let me know anything of
moment that occurs to you, and I will turn my thoughts to winning the
assent which is either to ruin our friend’s influence or discredit his
cause, or both.”
</p>

<p>
“The task could not be in abler hands, madame. Perhaps I might venture
to offer one single suggestion? I hear rumours that the Mortimer is
aiming at the throne of Thracia for his niece.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, he wishes her to supplant my daughter?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly so, madame. The presumption of the idea is atrocious, but it
occurs to me that it might prove useful. It might be possible to lead
him on by its means. For instance, from an incautious remark he let
drop, it seems to me that his Majesty must have made overtures to him,
with the view of inducing him to return to Thracia. That opens up
dangerous possibilities, but it also gives us some idea how to set to
work.”
</p>

<p>
“I see.” The Princess sat with her black brows drawn together.
</p>

<p>
“And now, madame, I will depart, if your Royal Highness will permit
me. It would not look well to lose my train after starting in such
excellent time. You wished me to convey a letter to the Emperor, I
believe?”
</p>

<p>
The Princess unlocked her writing-case, and took out a sealed
envelope, which Prince Soudaroff placed in an inner pocket. Kissing
the hand which the Princess extended to him, he took his leave, and
quitted the villa with the same precautions as he had observed on
entering it. His carriage was waiting for him under the wall of the
park, and he was quickly embarked on the long drive necessary to bring
him to Charlottenbad and the train.
</p>


<h3 id="ch05">
CHAPTER V.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE CROWN MATRIMONIAL.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">It</span> was with a sardonic chuckle that Prince Mirkovics remarked the
next morning to his pretty German daughter-in-law, whom he had
summoned by telegraph from Thracia to assist him upon this momentous
occasion, that the entertainment he was offering to his future Queen
was favoured with Queen’s weather. The irony underlying the speech was
necessarily lost upon Princess Boris, to whom Princess Lida of
Dardania was the only possible Queen for Thracia, but she responded
with sympathetic cheerfulness, relieved to be able to display her new
Felix gown without offering it up as a sacrifice to her loyalty. The
locality of the picnic had cost Prince Mirkovics much anxious thought,
but he had fixed at last upon a spot known as the Tannenspitze, a
grassy hill-top emerging from a sea of pines, and commanding an
extensive view. Carriages were to convey the party from Ludwigsbad to
the foot of the hill, but the summit itself could only be approached
on foot, by means of a variety of intricate paths through the
pine-woods, and this it was that rendered the place specially suitable
in view of Prince Mirkovics’s purposes. The arrangements generally
were left in the hands of Princess Boris, who was dominated by the
ambition of giving the smartest picnic Ludwigsbad had ever seen. This
necessitated an expenditure at which the frugal soul of her
father-in-law rose in shocked revolt, but he remembered in time the
stakes for which he was playing, and held his peace.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the magnitude of the preparations for their entertainment,
the list of those invited was rather select than lengthy. The guest of
the day was naturally Princess Lida, a young lady of seventeen,
endowed with a tact and assurance that would have done credit to a
world-worn society leader of seventy. It pleased her Highness, who may
or may not have received a hint from her mother before starting, to
single out Philippa as the object of her special favour, and enlist
her as her inseparable companion for the day. Philippa must sit beside
her in the carriage, and walk with her through the pine-woods, and
give detailed answers to an endless list of searching questions as to
her home life, her favourite pursuits, her tastes, and her ancestry.
The easy persistence with which Princess Lida imposed her will upon
the whole party, and her stamp upon the conversation, astonished and
oppressed the English girl, who felt herself overgrown and unfinished
and badly dressed in the presence of this very self-possessed young
lady. The only misgiving which had afflicted Philippa on starting,
relative to her gown of white cloth, with its edging of gold cord, and
pale blue silk shirt, was the fear that something darker would be more
suitable for a rough country walk. Now, however, as she contemplated
Princess Lida’s delicate silver-grey silk and black lace, and the
marvellous confection of <i>pervenche</i> cashmere, decked in bewildering
fashion with velvet bows, diamond buttons, iridescent embroidery, and
silk fringe, which Princess Boris had considered fitting wear for the
occasion, she owned to herself that the dress she had worn at the
Marlborough House garden-party, a few weeks back, would not have been
at all too smart. A miserable consciousness of her shoes also
oppressed her, for they were English-made and serviceable, and
contrasted painfully with the fairy-like foot-gear, high-heeled and
highly decorated, of the other ladies.
</p>

<p>
When the carriages had been left behind, however, and the walk through
the woods began, Philippa found that the advantage was on her own
side, but she thought Prince Mirkovics need not have emphasised this
superiority in the way he did. Noticing the difficulty with which
Princess Lida stumbled along the rough track, he devoted himself
ostentatiously to removing the stones from her path, accompanying his
attentions with remarks which the two girls were fain to regard as
breathing loyalty and respect, but which seemed fated to move King
Michael and his suite to bursts of ill-concealed laughter. It was a
relief to Philippa when their host insisted at last on offering his
arm to the Princess, and provided a cavalier for herself in the shape
of Captain Roburoff, who appeared to have altogether forgotten and
forgiven the snub he had received only five days ago at her
godmother’s hands. He spoke of Cyril and his efforts to solve the
Jewish problem with so much interest and appreciation that Philippa,
unconscious that a word from Prince Soudaroff had led him to read up
the subject carefully, felt her heart warm towards him, and conversed
with an animation such as she rarely showed to strangers.
</p>

<p>
Cyril himself was unable to spare time for the picnic, which caused
Prince Mirkovics a secret guilty satisfaction, but he had generously
given Mansfield a day’s holiday, which had so far failed to bring the
secretary the pleasure he had expected. Philippa’s society was
unattainable, and in despair Mansfield attached himself to another
disconsolate young Englishman, who knew no one but the friends with
whom he had come. Together they forsook the beaten track in favour of
a torrent-bed, which afforded them a good deal of scrambling and a
certain amount of risk, arousing thereby the longing envy of Usk, who
had been delivered over to the tender mercies of Princess Lida’s
lady-in-waiting. Countess Birnsdorf was stiff, elderly, and
unappreciative of rural delights, and she subjected Usk to a severe
cross-examination, with the view of discovering whether he was really
“born,” in the German sense of the word. His light-hearted confession
that he really could not answer half her questions without looking up
his family history in the ‘Peerage’ shocked and startled her, and he
detected a perceptible shrinking from his society until she had
satisfied herself as to the length of time the Mortimers had reigned
at Llandiarmid, and the arms they had borne at different epochs. Early
study of the carvings and stained glass in the Castle hall had
rendered Usk well versed in these, and before the hill-top was
reached, the Countess had come to look upon him almost with
friendliness. The feeling was not reciprocated, however, and Usk was
base enough to turn his charge over to Mansfield’s unhappy friend, who
had in some way contrived to lose his companion in the wood, and
approached to ask whether Usk had seen him. Quieting his conscience
with the excuse that it would be quite a novel and exciting sensation
for the Countess to tall for the first time to some one who was not
“born,” Usk slipped away to find Mansfield, whom he discovered engaged
in a solitary search for adventures in the miniature cavern where the
stream took its rise. In this Usk joined him, and they wasted all the
vestas they had with them, made themselves decidedly wet, and tore
their clothes a little, enjoying themselves thoroughly the while. When
the want of matches rendered further exploration impracticable, they
remembered reluctantly their duty to the rest of the party, and were
retracing their steps to the summit of the hill, when there was a
flash of blue and white through the trees, and the two young men were
suddenly confronted by Philippa, who burst upon them, flushed and
panting.
</p>

<p>
“Usk,” she cried fiercely, “if you let that odious little cad come
near me again, I’ll never speak another word to you in my life!”
</p>

<p>
“Which I wish to remark, that your language is strong, Phil,” observed
Usk mildly.
</p>

<p>
Mansfield’s eyes blazed as he turned upon him. “For shame, Usk!
Doesn’t it matter to you that your sister has been insulted? Who is
it, Lady Phil? that Scythian fellow?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” panted Philippa, “it’s the King. But Usk is quite right. It
was silly of me to be so excited. Oh, please, Mr Mansfield, don’t go.
I&mdash;I want you to hear how it was. Please stay here.”
</p>

<p>
She caught his hand and held it, and Mansfield, before whose eyes had
floated a vision in which his stick made closer acquaintance with King
Michael’s sacred person than the monarch would be likely to consider
agreeable, allowed himself to be persuaded to remain, more especially
since Usk gave him a warning look behind Philippa’s back. “This is my
affair. You have no right to interfere,” the look meant, and Mansfield
was forced to submit.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose they must have arranged it beforehand,” Philippa went on,
“for you know, Usk, I was walking with Captain Roburoff. He talked so
nicely about Uncle Cyril, and told me such interesting things about
the Jews in Scythia, that I never thought about the path until he
stopped suddenly, and said, ‘A thousand pardons, mademoiselle! What a
fool I am! I have lost the way,’ and then I found that none of the
others were in sight, and I could not hear their voices either.
Captain Roburoff seemed dreadfully sorry, and asked me to sit down on
a fallen tree while he went on a little farther to see where the path
led to. I said I was not tired, but he persisted I must be, and I
thought he would fancy that I was afraid to stay in the wood alone, so
I sat down. He was out of sight among the trees almost at once, and it
really was rather lonely, so that I was quite glad when I heard him
coming back, as I thought. But it wasn’t Captain Roburoff at all, it
was the King, and he said he had flown to the relief of the distressed
damsel, and talked a lot of nonsense about wood-nymphs, and tried to
pay me compliments about&mdash;about my hair, you know, and that sort of
thing. I nearly laughed, but I thought it might be his way of being
polite, so I walked on with him. Then we came to a rather steep place,
and he would insist on helping me up it (though I believe I could have
helped him much better), and he squeezed my hand. I pulled it away at
once, and he said, in the most idiotic way, ‘Would that I might call
that fair hand mine for ever!’ I thought that was going rather far,
even for a foreigner, so I made some remark about Princess Lida, just
to recall her to his mind. Then he flew out and said that he hated
Princess Lida, that his mother and the Princess of Dardania had
arranged the marriage when he was a baby, and had brought him up to
look upon it as a settled thing, and that Princess Lida had no soul,
and not a thought in common with him, and he was tired of her very
name, and he would be graciously pleased to marry me instead. Fancy&mdash;a
boy years younger than I am! He had got sentimental again by that
time, but I was so angry that I gave him a good talking-to, and told
him that he ought to be ashamed of himself, and that Princess Lida was
perfectly lovely, and would make him a far better queen than he had
any right to expect, and then he went into such a passion! I think he
must have expected me to regard his offer as a sort of command, to be
obeyed without question, for he said that the Princess of Dardania and
her daughter were the curse of Thracia, and that it would be my fault
if the kingdom was ruined and he went to the bad. I wanted to box his
ears, and at last I was really afraid I should, for he was just like a
little boy who ought to be put in a corner, so I came away. Usk, do
you think he was mad&mdash;or <i>drunk</i>?” Philippa ended the story of her
wrongs in an awestruck whisper.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t know, I am sure. I shall speak to him and see.”
</p>

<p>
“No, Usk, you’d better not. You know father told us to be sure to
consult Uncle Cyril at once if the slightest attempt was made to
entangle us in politics while we were abroad, and I suppose this must
be the sort of thing he meant.”
</p>

<p>
“Would you like me to tell Count Mortimer when I see him to-night,
Lady Phil?” asked Mansfield. A horrible suspicion had seized him that
Cyril might have some hand in the affair. He hated himself for the
thought, but his short intercourse with his employer had served to
assure him that over-scrupulousness was not one of Cyril’s failings.
If he was indeed in King Michael’s confidence, and Philippa discovered
the fact, the enthusiastic love she cherished for her uncle would be
destroyed for ever, and Mansfield made up his mind to spare her the
pain of such a disillusionment.
</p>

<p>
“Oh no,” she answered, flushing scarlet. “I could not let any one else
tell him about such a horrid thing. I must do it myself.”
</p>

<p>
“I would make as little of it as possible,” said Mansfield, with
assumed unconcern. “I shall see him before you do, that’s all.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh yes, please tell him, then. Perhaps he might say we ought not to
have lost time. But you won’t leave me alone all afternoon, Usk, will
you? or if Usk is called away, you’ll stay with me, won’t you, Mr
Mansfield?”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield assured her of his constant attendance with a warmth that
drew another warning look from Usk, and they returned to the rest of
the party, who were all somewhat ruffled, owing to the obvious
ill-temper of King Michael. He was seated between his <i>fiancée</i> and
Princess Boris, doing his best to make both ladies uncomfortable, and
the appearance of Philippa with her bodyguard produced no improvement
in his mood, since all Prince Mirkovics’s tactics failed to separate
the three. Even when Princess Lida claimed Philippa again after lunch
as her companion, Usk and Mansfield followed the two girls at a
discreet distance, much to the disapproval of the lady-in-waiting, who
suspected in them a romantic adoration for her charge. By affecting an
abnormal denseness, and complete ignorance of the French language,
they succeeded in baffling their host’s efforts to detach them from
Philippa, and when they returned to Ludwigsbad in the evening they
were able to boast that King Michael had not ventured to approach her
again. Mansfield saw Usk and his sister safely deposited at Princess
Soudaroff’s lodgings, and returned reluctantly to the Hôtel Waldthier
to tell his story to Cyril. He could not bring himself to look at his
employer during the recital, for the fear which had seized him at
first had become almost a certainty, and it was with a shock of
anticipation rather than surprise that he heard Cyril say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“So soon? The young rascal has lost no time, certainly.”
</p>

<p>
“Count, you didn’t know of this?” The agony of entreaty in his own
voice startled Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“May I ask what business it is of yours?”
</p>

<p>
“I couldn’t&mdash;I can’t believe it. Some one told me once that you spared
no one when it was a question of politics, but I can’t believe you
would expose your own niece to unpleasantness simply to further your
schemes.”
</p>

<p>
“A Daniel come to judgment! The unpleasantness was soon over, on your
own showing.”
</p>

<p>
“It would not have been in the case of any other girl. It might have
led her into awful trouble. Lady Phil is different. She would not let
herself be tempted by a crown.”
</p>

<p>
“In view of your position with regard to my brother’s family,”
remarked Cyril icily, “your interference in this affair is open to
objection.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield’s accusing eyes fell, but he recovered himself quickly. “I
can’t deny that I love Lady Phil, Count; but that doesn’t deprive me
of the right a man has to help any girl that he may see placed in an
unfair position.”
</p>

<p>
“And what is the exact nature of the help you propose to render?”
</p>

<p>
“To resign my post with you, and telegraph to Lord Caerleon. Lady Phil
shall never hear the full truth, if I can help it. I think it would
break her heart to know that you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield’s voice faltered, and Cyril’s keen eyes scrutinised him
curiously.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know that you are a fool, Mansfield?&mdash;an honest, blundering
idiot? I won’t accept your resignation, do you hear?&mdash;though I should
be justified in doing so, after the way you have spoken to me. How
dare you expect me to defend myself against your suspicions? You know
you had given me up as a bad lot. Well, all I knew of the matter was a
hint last night from Prince Soudaroff that young Michael had fallen in
love with my niece, but I refused to have anything to do with it. And
even now I know that you trust me no further than you can see me.”
</p>

<p>
“Forgive me, Count. If you knew how I hated the thought&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I should grovel before you in mingled pity and admiration, no doubt.
But why I should care a farthing about your opinion of me I don’t
know. I have never defended myself to any one before, but you are
really too young and idyllic for this wicked world. Well, you may be
easy about my niece. I will put a stop to King Michael’s love-making.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield’s mind was in a whirl as he departed. He had not known
hitherto what power Cyril possessed over him, nor with what mastery he
could play upon his feelings; but he felt now that if he had found his
employer guilty of the baseness he had suspected in him, it would have
been a blow second only to the loss of Philippa herself. The
unworthiness of his late suspicions cut him to the heart, and his
whole demeanour the next day was a mute entreaty for pardon, which
amused Cyril not a little. Even an incident which would have aroused
his misgivings the day before had now no power to disturb his trust.
</p>

<p>
The early promenade and the open-air breakfast were over, and
tranquillity had settled down upon the place for the space of those
morning hours which Ludwigsbad holds sacred to rest and seclusion. At
the Hôtel Waldthier Mansfield sat writing in the little anteroom of
Cyril’s <i>appartement</i>, whence he could command the side-door which was
reserved for Count Mortimer’s visitors. Many strange guests had
Mansfield admitted at that door, from royal princes to
poverty-stricken Jews, but it was startling even to him to observe a
stage conspirator approaching it. The visitor wore a soft felt hat
pulled down over his face, and a greatcoat with the collar turned
up&mdash;an attire singularly unsuited to the weather,&mdash;and he glanced from
side to side, starting at the slightest sound, in a very realistic
manner. After stepping noiselessly up to the door, and apparently
satisfying himself that he was unobserved, he returned on tiptoe to
the gateway by which he had entered the garden, and brought back with
him another person attired like himself. Together they approached
Mansfield’s window, and the first man made signs expressive of a
desire to enter without attracting attention. Leaving his desk,
Mansfield admitted them at the private door. They entered without
uttering a word, but, once in the room, the second turned down his
collar and disclosed the features of King Michael.
</p>

<p>
“Are we alone, and unobserved?” he demanded of his companion.
</p>

<p>
“Absolutely so, my liege,” returned Captain Roburoff, in accents that
suggested a certain difficulty in speaking. The King turned
majestically to Mansfield, who half expected to hear himself addressed
as “Minion.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell Count Mortimer that I wish to see him,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“I will inquire whether his Excellency is at leisure, sir,” responded
Mansfield, who would have given much to deny the monarch admittance
altogether. But although Cyril raised his eyebrows quizzically, and
asked whether Mansfield would wish to be present during the interview,
he rose at once and came to the door to welcome his royal visitor.
</p>

<p>
“To what am I indebted for this supreme honour, sir?” he inquired when
they were alone.
</p>

<p>
“Be seated, Count,” replied King Michael affably. “I am here on a
friendly errand, I assure you.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril bowed and obeyed, and his visitor continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“I perceive, Count, that you are surprised by this private visit. No
doubt it will surprise you still more to learn that it is merely an
earnest of my good-will towards you. I admit that when I came to the
throne I acted hastily in accepting your resignation, but no one can
regret it more than I do. I look to you, as a fair-minded man, to
place the blame where it is due. My mind had been poisoned against
you&mdash;by whom, you can guess.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril bowed again in silence. King Michael went on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“I have made up my mind to redress the injustice into which I was
hurried. In their eagerness to aggrandise their own family, my mother
and the Princess of Dardania induced me to engage myself to Princess
Ludmilla, and by means of this quasi-promise the Princess of Dardania
has contrived to exercise a wholly unwarranted authority over myself
and the kingdom. I have determined to put an end to it. The Princess’s
influence is injurious to Thracia, and her daughter is personally
distasteful to myself. The position which she hopes to occupy I
destine for your niece, Lady Philippa Mortimer, and I desire your
assistance in the matter.”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” interjected Cyril, with startling suddenness.
</p>

<p>
“I think you forget to whom you are speaking, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“No, sir. I do not forget that for the sake of the girl you now wish
to cast aside you broke the heart of the mother who had sacrificed her
life’s happiness for you and your kingdom.”
</p>

<p>
The King’s sallow face grew livid. “If all that is said is true, you
are not the man to talk to me of cruelty to her Majesty, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“At least I can say that I have repented my cruelty from that day to
this. You have not.” Cyril’s eyes were flashing, and his even voice
was charged with thunder. King Michael and he had both risen to their
feet, and were confronting each other angrily across the table.
</p>

<p>
“We are losing time in these irrelevant recriminations, Count,” said
the King, recovering himself. “I wish you to undertake the conduct of
this affair. You will return to office, of course&mdash;I give you <i>carte
blanche</i> with regard to the wretched crew of incapables at present in
power&mdash;but I do not know whether you will prefer to rid me of the
Princess of Dardania and her daughter before setting to work. I leave
the method to you&mdash;you are an old enemy of her Royal Highness, I
believe?&mdash;and I don’t stipulate for any special tenderness towards
either of them. Afterwards you will take the proper steps to obtain
Lady Philippa’s hand for me. I believe I alarmed the young lady
yesterday by avowing my sentiments too openly; no doubt she thought
such warmth incorrect in view of Princess Lida’s presence in the
company; but you will do everything in due form. You hesitate? You
think I am making a cat’s paw of you?” A grim smile crossed Cyril’s
face. “I am willing to repeat before witnesses the orders I have given
you, if you will call in Roburoff and your secretary.”
</p>

<p>
“Quite unnecessary.” Cyril had regained his usual calm. “You broke the
heart of the woman who gave up everything for you, and now you want to
throw away the toy for the sake of which you did it. But that you
won’t do. I don’t pose as a moralist, but I have some sense of the
fitness of things. At the rate you are going, it won’t be long before
you are unfit to speak to a decent woman, and you expect me to give
you my niece! Why, I should have scruples about marrying you to
Princess Lida, if I had any responsibility in the matter, but her
mother and you settled that between you, and you shall stick to it. If
I am not mistaken, she will turn out a match for you. But at any rate,
for your mother’s sake, I will see that her wishes on the subject are
carried out.”
</p>

<p>
The fierce irony of the tone roused the King to something very like
frenzy. “If I don’t marry your niece, I’ll make you sorry that you
refused her to me,” he muttered, his lips twitching and his fingers
picking nervously at his chin.
</p>

<p>
“The first word you say against her will be the signal for your own
destruction,” said Cyril coldly. “I am not in the habit of speaking
idly, and I warn you that you are still on the throne only because I
have not cared to dethrone you. But if you are good enough to furnish
me with a reason for taking action&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t revenge myself upon women,” snarled the King, forgetting his
threat of the moment before.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you are young yet,” replied Cyril pleasantly. “Permit me to
attend your Majesty to the door.”
</p>

<p>
In the anteroom Captain Roburoff, who had been amusing himself with
trying to torment Mansfield by means of hints as to the King’s
matrimonial intentions, jumped up in a hurry when his sovereign
appeared. He expected a return to the elaborate ceremonial which had
marked their entrance into the hotel, but King Michael strode out of
the room without a word, neglecting all the precautions he had seen
fit to adopt, and Mansfield breathed freely. It was evident that here
was no accepted lover, and the refusal appeared to have been
accompanied by a little wholesome plain speaking. On Cyril the
impression left by the interview was one of unmitigated disgust.
</p>

<p>
“<i>That</i> Ernestine’s boy!” he muttered, as Prince Mirkovics had done
before him. “Well, it’s a good thing that the young blackguard forgot
himself so far as to threaten poor little Phil. It forces me to make
things safe by cutting the ground from under his feet. So now to
business!”
</p>

CHAPTER VI.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub"><i>DANAOS DONA FERENTES.</i></span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Telling</span> Mansfield that he was going for a stroll, and should
probably lunch at Princess Soudaroff’s&mdash;a piece of information that
filled the secretary with unavailing envy&mdash;Cyril took the road which
led to the villa occupied by the Princess of Dardania. Reaching the
door, he was greeted with stares of surprise by the servants on the
steps and in the hall, and his request to be permitted to wait upon
the Princess was regarded with amazement, not unmixed with suspicion.
</p>

<p>
“Her Royal Highness does not receive visitors,” he was told, while his
card was handed round and scrutinised with something of awe.
</p>

<p>
“I think her Royal Highness will receive me,” he answered calmly,
wishing he was as sure of the fact as he pretended to be. No one knew
better than he did that he was making a hazardous stroke. If it
failed, his old enemy would have scored a point. But his confident air
impressed the servants sufficiently to induce them to carry his name
to the Princess, and her reception of it established him in their
respect. Princess Ottilie was beginning to be anxious about the
fulfilment of her compact with Prince Soudaroff. Two days had passed
since his visit, and she had made no progress towards securing the
coveted governorship for her son. Worse than this, there seemed to be
no means even of sounding Cyril upon the subject, unless she went so
far as to make direct advances, such as he would probably take delight
in repulsing. Not knowing that she had become necessary to his
schemes, she had never dared to hope that the first overtures would
come from him, and the announcement that he asked to see her was music
in her ears. She gave orders that he should be admitted at once, and
when he was ushered into her boudoir he found her standing beside the
table to receive him, a majestic figure in her sweeping black robes.
Why was it that Cyril’s heart flew straightway to another woman who
had worn similar weeds, which, so far from enhancing such beauty as
she possessed, had only served to accentuate the slenderness of her
form and deprive her of every vestige of colour? The Princess of
Dardania looked more magnificent even than of old, the severity of the
garb exhibiting her stately stature to the fullest advantage.
</p>

<p>
“A year ago,” she said, “I should have hesitated to receive Count
Mortimer, fearing that he came as an enemy; but now”&mdash;her eyes strayed
to the large portrait of her late husband which stood upon the
table&mdash;“I cannot believe that he would seek my presence with the
desire of adding to my misfortunes.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, madame, my sole reason for entreating an audience is the
double hope of doing you a service and of obtaining a favour from
you.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me the last first, Count, that I may at any rate have the
pleasure of granting it.”
</p>

<p>
“It grows out of the first, madame, and I will therefore ask
permission to defer it for a moment. Your Royal Highness will
recollect that when we last met I had the misfortune to differ from
you with regard to the affairs of Thracia?”
</p>

<p>
The Princess remembered Prince Soudaroff’s hint, and trembled in spite
of herself. Had her old enemy come to announce the downfall of her
dearest hopes? She inclined her head slightly in answer to the
question, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
“You favoured a certain policy, madame, which I opposed. Your advice
prevailed. I bowed to circumstances, and quitted Thracia. I have now
no wish to disturb the settlement then arrived at, although I think
your Royal Highness will perceive presently that I could easily do
so.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t understand you, Count. Pray do not speak in riddles.”
</p>

<p>
“To speak plainly, madame, the King of Thracia has been seized with a
violent&mdash;we will hope only evanescent&mdash;passion for my niece.”
</p>

<p>
“Surely you forget that his Majesty is betrothed to my daughter,
Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Say rather, madame, that his Majesty has forgotten it, since this
morning he directed me to make formal proposals to my brother for his
daughter’s hand.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, really, Count, this is too absurd! His Majesty must be out of his
mind.”
</p>

<p>
“The derangement is merely temporary, madame. My niece regards it in
that light, I assure you. She was horrified by the King’s proposal.”
</p>

<p>
“I congratulate you on the good sense of the young lady, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“I am indeed to be congratulated, madame; but I can see that this
vexatious affair may have disagreeable consequences, of which my niece
does not dream. I understand that at the picnic yesterday his Majesty
made her unpleasantly conspicuous by his attentions. Her natural
impulse is to leave Ludwigsbad immediately; but such a flight would
only cause the sensation we wish to avoid. You acknowledge, madame,
that Lady Philippa has behaved well, you have honoured her parents
with your friendship&mdash;you must see that there is only one means of
averting such gossip as would be equally painful to you and to them.”
</p>

<p>
The Princess’s countenance cleared. “Have you heard, Count, that my
daughter hurt her foot yesterday, and is condemned to the sofa for
several days? She has conceived a romantic attachment for your pretty
niece, and it would cheer her to have her society. Do you think Lady
Philippa’s excellent godmother would spare her to us for a week? If
so, I will send Countess Birnsdorf to bring her here.”
</p>

<p>
“I feel sure that Princess Soudaroff will rejoice to sacrifice herself
on Princess Lida’s behalf, madame. The King, of course&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“The King is about to join a shooting-party in the mountains. I heard
the news just before you came.”
</p>

<p>
“That removes my sole anxiety, madame. Your Royal Highness will
condescend to accept my thanks for your great kindness?”
</p>

<p>
“Wait, Count. There is something I wish to say. Do you remember
telling me that if I tried to rule the Balkans without your help I
should fail? It is true; I have proved it. But who could have imagined
that it would be the ingratitude and disobedience of my own children
which would bring about the fulfilment of your prophecy?”
</p>

<p>
“You have my sincerest sympathy, madame.”
</p>

<p>
“My eldest daughter, as you know, is married to King Albrecht of
Mœsia. I thought him all I could desire; he seemed thoroughly in
sympathy with my schemes; but no sooner was he married than he became
a German of the Germans, and Bettine followed his example. Thus I lost
Mœsia from my Slavonic confederation. But with my son it was even
worse. You know, of course, that he was to marry the Grand-Duchess
Sonya Eugenovna. Her mother has long been dead, and she spent much of
her time with me. All seemed to go well between her and Alexis; but
shortly before his father died, when I wished him to propose to her,
he refused flatly. He had met Princess Emilia of Magnagrecia at the
Pannonian Court, and declared that he would marry no one else. In vain
I pointed out the disgrace he was bringing upon me; he married
Princess Emilia a month ago; and now I am only welcome in Dardania, as
in Mœsia, on sufferance. Surely even you must pity me?”
</p>

<p>
“Madame,” interposed Cyril, in tones of deep emotion, “your gracious
confidence forces me to speak. The idea of detaching your son from the
Grand-Duchess Sonya, and attracting him to the lady who is now his
wife, was mine.”
</p>

<p>
The Princess sat as if stunned. She had known the truth perfectly
well, and Cyril was aware of this. It was his confession that took her
by surprise. “You have made amends by your chivalrous action to-day,”
she said at last, with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
“Your kindness overwhelms me, madame. Have I your Highness’s
permission to retire? I know my presence must be distasteful.”
</p>

<p>
“No; there is something else you can do, Count. I have another son,
and I have set my heart on his becoming governor of Palestine. That is
in your power to bring about.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas, madame! Why ask me the one impossible thing? The decision does
not rest with me, nor even with my friends.”
</p>

<p>
The Princess smiled more gently still. “I must take the will for the
deed, I suppose?” she said. “That is poor comfort for an anxious
mother, Count. But don’t think I blame you. You will come here
occasionally when your niece is with us, and assure yourself that we
are taking proper care of her? We need not sadden the young with the
knowledge of our troubles. Come as often as you like, and do not feel
compelled to ask for me. I cannot forget that I am growing old.”
</p>

<p>
“Then, madame, you succeed where all the rest of the world has
failed,” responded Cyril, kissing the beautiful hand she held out to
him. His manner was remorseful, and his eyes lingered on her face as
he left the room. As soon as he was gone, the Princess crossed the
floor to a large mirror.
</p>

<p>
“He was more nearly human than I have ever known him,” she mused.
“What can it be?” She smiled consciously as her eyes fell upon the
reflection in the glass. “Would it be possible? What a triumph! to
have him at my feet! But he is dangerous; I dare not trust him. There
is Ernestine, too; I must sound him on that subject. That will give me
some clue to his present feelings. He is open to conviction on the
subject of Kazimir, I think; but even that would be nothing in
comparison with the joy of snatching him from Ernestine. But I must
not think of that. I must keep cool. If he once gets the upper hand,
all is lost. I am glad I thought of giving him a general invitation.
Ah, Birnsdorf,” as the lady-in-waiting appeared at the door, “I want
you to take one of the carriages, and go to Princess Soudaroff’s
lodgings. You will carry a note from me, and bring back Lady Philippa
Mortimer. Impress upon the old fanatic that Lida is making herself ill
for want of the girl, and say anything else that occurs to you as
likely to weigh with her.”
</p>

<p>
Countess Birnsdorf curtseyed and retired, and executed her mission
with so much success that Philippa returned with her to the villa
within an hour. Cyril had prepared Princess Soudaroff’s mind for the
request, and the Countess worked skilfully upon her feelings; hence
the easy victory.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The week of Philippa’s stay at the villa&mdash;a stay which she discovered
to be intended as a reward for what Countess Birnsdorf called the
“delicate correctness” of her conduct&mdash;was not a period of unmixed
bliss. The house and grounds were beautiful, and the etiquette exacted
by the Princess not excessive, but the atmosphere was new and
disagreeable to Philippa. The air seemed full of plots, every one
appeared to be playing a part, and the unreality oppressed her, while
her usual home remedy for bad spirits, a brisk ride or a long ramble
over the hills, was unattainable. She complained afterwards that she
never had a chance of blowing the cobwebs away, restricted as she was
to stately promenades with Countess Birnsdorf, or funereal drives in a
closed carriage with the Princess. Nor were her troubles wholly
physical. Her father’s wisdom in declining a crown, and preferring
England to the Continent as a residence, commended itself to her more
and more when she told herself that even she, placed in Princess
Lida’s circumstances, might have learned to share her views of right
and wrong. Princess Lida, she found, had fallen deeply in love, not
with King Michael, but with a gentleman occupying an official position
of some sort, to whose identity she gave no clue, intending, possibly,
that Philippa should elicit it by means of cross-examination. But
Philippa was disappointing. She was as much shocked as the Princess
could desire, but not so much at the existence of the attachment as at
the fact that it was not intended to lead to anything more. She
listened with but slight interest to Princess Lida’s vivacious
enumeration of the various artifices by which she and her lover
contrived to carry on their flirtation under the very noses of the
Princess of Dardania and Countess Birnsdorf, and she interrupted the
history of a certain Court ball, at which the pair had succeeded in
exchanging notes, by the question&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“But what do you mean to do about him?”
</p>

<p>
“Do? What is there to be done? I suppose we shall simply go on.”
</p>

<p>
“But you can’t intend to marry King Michael when you care for this
other man?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I do. It has been arranged for me.”
</p>

<p>
“What does that signify? It would be wrong.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you English, with your right and wrong! I don’t trouble my head
with all that. I take my pleasure as it comes.”
</p>

<p>
“But you would be miserable, married to a man you didn’t love.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, the good Philippa is trying to persuade me to run away with the
other! I must tell mamma. She little thinks what a serpent she has
welcomed into her home, to poison the innocent mind of her child! But
you mistake me, my Lippchen. The misery would be if I married the
other. I want jewellery and Paris gowns and a gay Court, not love in
a four-roomed flat. One of the Pannonian Archduchesses has tried that.
She comes to the Schloss (only to family gatherings, of course) in a
common cab, and makes her own dresses, I believe. Can you imagine my
doing that sort of thing?”
</p>

<p>
“I never thought of advising you to run away,” said Philippa
indignantly, “and if you are only thinking of what you can get, you
had certainly better not try it. But you could remain unmarried. That
would be better than&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Than marrying the King? Thank you, Lippchen! It’s quite clear that
you don’t know the sort of life a Princess leads if she doesn’t happen
to marry. No position, no independence, patronised and pushed aside by
her relations, obliged to become a dowdy old devotee through sheer
terror of scandal, for there is no mercy for any one who is remotely
suspected of a tendency to disgrace the house. A convent or a
fortress, there’s your choice! No, I shall marry King Michael and keep
him in order, at any rate in public, and we will have the gayest Court
in Europe. Oh, you may trust me to keep up appearances when I have got
the reality.”
</p>

<p>
Philippa was too much disgusted to answer, and Princess Lida, turning
restlessly on her couch, broke into a laugh at the sight of her
disapproving face.
</p>

<p>
“You are too delightfully innocent, Lippchen! But, after all, I am in
the right. My mother has brought me up, educated me, trained me, with
the sole intention of my making this marriage. You would not have me
disappoint her&mdash;and myself? Is that how you intend to treat your
parents when they present your future husband to you?”
</p>

<p>
“People don’t do that in England,” with dignity.
</p>

<p>
“Not among the lower orders, I know, but you are ‘highly well-born,’
as we say in German. Let us imagine an instance.” Princess Lida raised
herself on her elbow. “Suppose that secretary of your uncle’s declared
to you that he had conceived a passion for you”&mdash;she watched with
delight the flood of crimson which overspread Philippa’s face at this
rude handling of the secret, the existence of which she had scarcely
owned even to herself&mdash;“and you were not insensible to it&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“You have no right whatever to say such things!” cried Philippa,
finding her tongue.
</p>

<p>
“But, my Lippchen,” with extreme simplicity, “no one could have seen
the poor young man in your society the other day without perceiving
what his feelings were. Your response I am only imagining for the sake
of argument. Well, your parents declare the idea preposterous, and
inform you that you have been destined all your life for some elderly
red-faced provincial nobleman. What will you do?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I would never marry any one without my father’s consent.
But I should ask him to tell me his objections, and I know he would
treat me as a reasonable being. Perhaps he might change his mind after
a time, but if not, I should go on just as I was. He would never try
to make me marry any one else.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you are too good, you and your parents!” cried Princess Lida, as
Philippa, her fair face crimson, put forth her defence like a
defiance; “but I have not such a considerate mother, and mamma has not
such an easily contented daughter. You see, the game would not be
worth the candle in my case.”
</p>

<p>
“That means you don’t love the other one well enough to give up
anything for his sake?”
</p>

<p>
“Exactly. I want to keep what I have, and to get all I can. Meanwhile,
I enjoy myself&mdash;quite decorously and without hurting any one.”
</p>

<p>
“But surely you are hurting him?”
</p>

<p>
“How? Oh, you mean if it came out. But I shan’t let it out, you see,
nor will he, for he is far too comfortable in his present post, just
as I am. Why shouldn’t I amuse myself like every one else? Mamma will
have her train of adorers as soon as she receives people again. Even
now she has your beloved uncle.”
</p>

<p>
“Princess!” Philippa’s cry was a passionate contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Princess Lida laughed. “Why, poor innocent Lippchen, you don’t imagine
that Count Mortimer comes here every day to see you? It is my mother
who is the attraction, not his dutiful niece. What! have I broken
another idol?”
</p>

<p>
For Philippa had sprung up with an inarticulate exclamation and rushed
out of the room. The sting of the accusation lay in the fact that her
reason assured her of its truth. It was not to see her that Cyril paid
his daily visits to the villa, passing on invariably from the large
drawing-room into the boudoir beyond, there to pay his respects to the
Princess. These interviews were protracted far beyond the limits
ordained by ceremony, and Countess Birnsdorf had felt it necessary to
apologise for their length by observing to Philippa that she was quite
glad to see Count Mortimer coming in, for no one else had been able to
induce the Princess to forget her sorrows in conversation since her
bereavement. This information Philippa had received with a certain
reserve, for the Princess had not struck her as overwhelmed with
grief; but she saw now that the old lady had been endeavouring to
divert her mind from a suspicion that had already troubled herself.
But had the idea occurred to Cyril? Could he know that the purport of
his visits was thus interpreted? Surely it could only be that,
impelled at first merely by the desire of cheering the Princess, he
had afterwards been attracted by the conversation of a clever and
brilliant woman? At any rate, he should be warned what people were
saying about him. With this resolve strong in her mind Philippa walked
to the garden-gate to meet her uncle, attended only by Princess Lida’s
white poodle. One glance at her troubled face showed Cyril that
something serious was in the air; but, in his usual teasing fashion,
he talked continuously on indifferent subjects. When they came in
sight of the house Philippa stopped short, in agony lest the
opportunity should be lost.
</p>

<p>
“Uncle Cyril, I want to ask you something. Is the Princess a friend of
yours? Usk and I always thought she had done something to injure you.”
</p>

<p>
“So she did, Phil. But is it your creed that once an enemy always an
enemy? No? Then you see I too can be virtuous and overlook my enemies’
faults&mdash;sometimes.”
</p>

<p>
“But they say&mdash;they say you want to marry her,” Philippa succeeded in
bringing out.
</p>

<p>
“Do they? How kind of them! Would you like the Princess for an aunt,
Phil? She’s a charming woman, isn’t she?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Uncle Cyril, you wouldn’t&mdash;you don’t mean it?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Phil, I have no present intention of inviting her to become
your aunt. Would you like to know why? Because I am afraid she would
say no, of course, and your feelings might be hurt.”
</p>

<p>
They had reached the villa by this time, and Philippa was left to her
own gloomy reflections. Whether her uncle was in earnest or not, it
was quite clear that he had no intention of taking her into his
confidence, and it did not occur to her that in the circumstances this
might be rather advantageous than otherwise. The least suspicious of
mortals, Philippa had not discovered that she was persistently
catechised as to Cyril’s future plans and his past history. The art
with which the subject was approached and the questions put was such
that she had no idea of its existence, nor yet of the fact that her
honest answers often caused much irritation to the questioner.
Philippa knew nothing of her uncle but what he chose to tell her,
together with the deductions drawn by Usk and herself from this
evidence, and she could not tell more than she knew. The Princess was
particularly curious as to the footing upon which Cyril now stood with
Queen Ernestine. Did he keep up any communication with her, or had
they parted for ever? Philippa had heard from Mansfield of Prince
Mirkovics’s defence of Queen Ernestine, and her prejudices were
somewhat modified; but she was still firm in the belief that her uncle
had been very badly treated. It was, therefore, not without
satisfaction that she informed the Princess of Cyril’s request, on his
return from Thracia, that the Queen’s name should not be mentioned in
his hearing, and added that, so far as she knew, he was of the same
mind still.
</p>

<p>
“And you are all considerate enough to do as he asked?” cried the
Princess, with a laugh in which relief mingled with something of
pique. “Why, if I were one of his family, and he had made such a
request of me, I should have done nothing but tease him to find out
what he really felt.”
</p>

<p>
Acting, presumably, upon this principle, the Princess prepared to seek
information from the best authority, since Philippa could tell her so
little. When she received Cyril that afternoon, she was sad and
preoccupied, and smiled only with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
“I fear you have had bad news, madame?” he suggested at last.
</p>

<p>
“Now how did you guess that?” she asked gratefully. “Yes, I have such
a painful account of my cousin, Queen Ernestine, from Syria.” Her
fingers played carelessly with a letter bearing a Roumi stamp as she
spoke. The letter was more than a year old, but Cyril was not supposed
to know that.
</p>

<p>
“Her Majesty is ill, madame?” he asked, in precisely the right tone of
respectful sympathy. A single glance had shown him that the letter was
not black-edged, and there was no fear that any news but the worst
would make him betray himself.
</p>

<p>
“No, not exactly ill; but she is subject to such strange delusions. We
hoped that the change of scene might benefit her, but I fear there can
be no doubt that her mind is permanently affected. Would you believe
it?&mdash;she will not see a man, or allow one to approach her. You know
she is residing with the Königshof deaconesses at their Institution
at Brutli, in the Lebanon? Well, I hear that only her ladies and
female attendants are allowed to be with her there&mdash;the gentlemen must
live in the village. It is entirely her own doing, for the Institution
would be quite willing to receive them, but she refuses to see even
the pastor belonging to the place. Isn’t it extraordinary?”
</p>

<p>
“Most extraordinary, madame.”
</p>

<p>
“And she has returned to the very deepest widow’s mourning, only
wearing white instead of black. It almost seems,” added the Princess
musingly, stealing a glance at Cyril from under the hand which was
shading her eyes, “as if she had had some experience which had
prejudiced her against your sex.”
</p>

<p>
“That seems the most probable explanation, madame. The difference with
his Majesty, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t think that would account for it; do you? No, on second
thoughts I rather fancy she must be conscious of having done a great
injury to some man, so that remorse drives her to this seclusion.”
</p>

<p>
“It is possible, madame. There have been cases in which women have
ruined the lives of men who were foolish enough to trust them.”
</p>

<p>
“You speak bitterly, Count. And what, in your opinion, is the usual
effect of such behaviour upon the man?”
</p>

<p>
“Simply, madame, that he determines never to place his future in the
power of a woman again.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you cherish your hatred so long, you men! We women soon grow
tired of perpetual animosities. But have you ever known what it is to
be so deceived, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“I have, madame.”
</p>

<p>
“And&mdash;and did you come to the usual determination?”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, I thought I had&mdash;until a week ago.”
</p>

<p>
The compliment was commonplace enough, but something in the tome, and
in the glance which accompanied it, thrilled the heart of the
Princess. Almost for the first time in her life she blushed like a
girl, and she changed the subject with a haste and maladroitness that
showed how deeply she was moved.
</p>

<p>
“By-the-bye, Count, I want you to tell me how your scheme is
progressing. Is it true that, as I see by this morning’s paper,
opposition to it is springing up in England?”
</p>

<p>
“Scarcely, madame. A vexatious incident has occurred, that is all.”
</p>

<p>
“Pray tell me about it. I thought you felt quite safe with regard to
your own country?”
</p>

<p>
“True, madame, except for such incidents as this. Before coming here,
I arranged matters with the Dowager Duchess of Old Sarum.”
</p>

<p>
“The Dowager? But has she any influence in politics?”
</p>

<p>
“The Duchess, madame, like my niece’s kind friend Princess Soudaroff,
is a lady who takes a deep interest in the conversion of the Jews to
Christianity. Fifty or sixty years ago people of her stamp believed
that the Jews could only be restored to Palestine in a Christianised
condition, and they founded the Jerusalem bishopric in order that the
converts might find some one there to receive them. Now their views
have undergone a slight change, and they think that the return to
Palestine is to come first and the conversion after it. Naturally,
then, they wish to hasten on the restoration, in order that the second
desirable event may follow as quickly as possible. Before leaving
England I had a long confidential talk with the Duchess, laid my plans
before her, and pointed out the dangers to which they were exposed.
She grasped the idea at once, and immediately volunteered her help to
smooth matters in England. I accepted it gladly, for she has a strong
influence over her son, the present Duke, and she is the sister of Mr
Forfar. Oh, the Duchess is a dear old lady!”
</p>

<p>
“But surely she has failed you now?”
</p>

<p>
“By no means, madame. It is a sad fact that there are some people in
England who take no interest in the conversion of the Jews&mdash;rather
dislike them than otherwise, indeed. The most prominent of these
anti-Semites (they are very mild, you understand) is Lord Ormsea, who
holds a minor post in the administration. He has picked up some
garbled idea of our intentions from the Continental press, and
speaking two nights ago at a public meeting, he thought fit to
denounce our scheme, and to invite the hostile attention of the Powers
to it. That’s all.”
</p>

<p>
“And what measures do you intend to take?”
</p>

<p>
“I hear from my friend the Chevalier Goldberg that he has arranged for
a fall in the price of Consols, madame, but I have told him that is a
mistake. The fall could not affect British credit, but it would give
colour to the accusations of Ormsea and his crew, and might stimulate
the nation to active hostility. England won’t stand being bullied,
though she will yield a good deal to friendly representations. I have
written to the Duchess, and I don’t doubt that the Government will
bring Ormsea to his senses in a very short time. Meanwhile, I hope the
financial panic may be stopped before anything serious happens.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish you would tell me how you manage that sort of thing,” sighed
the Princess.
</p>

<p>
“I’m afraid I can’t tell you that, madame,” was the reply, delivered
with so much suavity that the Princess could not decide whether want
of will or want of ability constituted the obstacle.
</p>

<p>
“After all, England has very little interest in the matter,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“Little enough, madame, especially after declaring, in one of her
periodical self-denying ordinances, that in no case would she permit
an Englishman to become governor of Palestine.”
</p>

<p>
“You do not always see eye to eye with your countrymen, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“I fear, madame, that I can scarcely consider myself an Englishman at
this late day, although my enemies are fond of saluting me with the
name.”
</p>

<p>
There was meaning in Cyril’s tone, although the eyes which met those
of the Princess were devoid of expression, and a novel and by no means
unpleasant idea struck her. She was revolving it hastily in her mind
when she spoke next, somewhat absently.
</p>

<p>
“Has anything happened?&mdash;does the deadlock still exist between your
Syndicate and Scythia?”
</p>

<p>
“There is no alteration, madame. Before Scythia will allow us to have
Palestine, she demands a promise that your son shall be the first
governor.”
</p>

<p>
“It is a great pity&mdash;I mean that such a good work should be stopped.
Will you accept me as an auxiliary, Count? or am I too transparent a
plotter? I will write to Pavelsburg, and represent that you are
powerless in the matter. Then perhaps the stipulation may be
withdrawn.”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, I am overjoyed by your condescension.” Cyril did not consider
it necessary to say that in any case the joint pressure of famine and
poverty must cause the withdrawal of Scythian opposition in a day or
two.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I assure you it will be a great delight if I can give you any
help. You will let me know how your difficulty with England ends? We
shall miss your charming niece terribly. I hope Princess Soudaroff
will spare her to us for a day now and then while she remains at
Ludwigsbad.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril retired, well content. He had secured what was of the greatest
moment to him, an invitation to continue his visits to the villa after
Philippa had quitted it on the morrow. When he had left her, the
Princess sat for some time musing deeply.
</p>

<p>
“I cannot be sure,” she murmured at last. “It is true that he seems to
have no feeling for Ernestine but that of dislike&mdash;certainly he does
not love her at this moment&mdash;but one can never tell. They might meet,
and the sight of her might revive all the old feelings. Those
caressing ways of hers!&mdash;and he is just the man to take a whimsical
pleasure in her perpetual inconsistency. How is he to be tested? for
I dare not risk anything until I am sure of him. He and I, reigning in
Palestine! <i>Palestine</i>? we would rule the world. How I should triumph
over Alexis and Bettine and the Powers! But there is always Ernestine
in the background. How am I to be rid of the fear of her? Ah, that
photograph! That will do what I want. He comes again, say, in a week;
there will be time to have it enlarged. Birnsdorf!” she raised her
voice, and the Countess entered, “I want you to write a letter to
Vindobona for me at once.”
</p>


<h3 id="ch07">
CHAPTER VII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">BREAKING WITH THE PAST.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">A week</span> had passed since Philippa’s departure from the villa before
she entered it again, accompanied by her uncle, to spend the day with
Princess Lida. Cyril’s presence had not been sought by his niece. In
fact, poor Philippa, terrified lest she should be helping to involve
him in the toils of the Princess of Dardania, had assured him plainly,
almost rudely, that she preferred to go by herself. But Cyril could be
singularly dense when he chose. He insisted that he had nothing
particular to do, and could find no more delightful employment for an
idle hour than escorting his niece to the villa. This assurance only
confirmed Philippa’s fears, and the crowning touch was put to her
misery by the message which awaited Cyril on his entrance, that the
Princess would be glad to see him if he could spare her a few minutes.
Philippa cast an imploring glance at him, but he smiled wickedly at
the sight of her woe-begone face, and followed the servant sent to
conduct him to the Princess’s boudoir.
</p>

<p>
“Some dodge on hand,” he muttered to himself, when the man had left
him with the announcement that her Royal Highness would receive him in
a short time. “I wonder what it is? Ah!”
</p>

<p>
His eye had been caught by an unfamiliar object in the room, a large
portrait on an easel, carelessly draped with a gold and crimson scarf.
It was turned away from him, and he went round the easel to look at
it, only to recoil with a start which even his self-control could not
restrain. The gay hues of the drapery served only to accentuate the
utter desolation revealed by the photograph. A woman, dressed in
white, was sitting listlessly upon a block of stone, her hands clasped
loosely in her lap. The portrait revealed with cruel distinctness the
grey hair, the lines in the worn face, and the unfathomable sorrow in
the hopeless eyes. The Princess had given special directions that the
reproduction was to be a faithful, not a flattering, one.
</p>

<p>
“Good heavens!” broke from Cyril under his breath, “and this is
Ernestine!”
</p>

<p>
The wild rush of remorse and pity almost made him stagger, as he stood
with clenched hands and compressed lip before the portrait; but it was
succeeded by a vehement indignation against the woman who had
deliberately prepared this miserable shock for him. “I showed you
little mercy when last we met, dearest,” he muttered, addressing the
pictured Ernestine; “but she shall have none.”
</p>

<p>
The sound of his own voice recalled him to himself, and before the
faint <i>frou-frou</i> of the Princess’s silk-lined robes, sweeping over
the polished floor, announced her approach, he had had time to compose
his features, and to adopt an attitude of interest, not untouched with
criticism, as he stood before the portrait. The Princess came rustling
in, exquisitely dressed (during the past week she had mitigated the
severity of her weeds in various scarcely perceptible ways, which
caused the general effect to be considerably less sombre), graceful
and gracious, with the utmost made of every good point in face and
figure. Truth to tell, her mood at the moment was not of the most
tranquil. It had been no part of her plan that Cyril should be left
alone with the portrait of his old love. She had intended to confront
him with it unexpectedly, and to scrutinise with jealous minuteness
the effect it produced upon him, but the stupidity of the footman had
prevented this. If she felt any anxiety as to the result of her
experiment, she did not betray it, however. Her whole manner was
expressive of a superb confidence in her own power to charm, as
compared with the faded and unhappy woman in the photograph. As she
entered, Cyril turned towards her with a start, letting his eye-glass
drop from his hand.
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, madame,” he said hastily, without waiting for her to speak
first, “but I cannot help tracing in this portrait some resemblance to
the features of my august mistress, Queen Ernestine. Surely it is not
possible that the photograph is hers?”
</p>

<p>
“Now who can have put that portrait here?” cried the Princess, in
tones of strong irritation. “Yes, it is the latest likeness of my poor
cousin, and I have just had it enlarged at Vindobona, but it was not
intended for exhibition in public. Birnsdorf is so officious!” She
lifted the scarf as though to cover the picture with it, but Cyril
stopped her.
</p>

<p>
“Permit me to entreat you to leave the portrait as it is, madame. If
your Royal Highness needed a foil, you could find no better one than
this.”
</p>

<p>
The callousness of the words would have disgusted most women, but they
rejoiced the Princess’s heart. Her expedient had succeeded. She let
the scarf fall, and stooped to look at the photograph more closely.
</p>

<p>
“There is no posing in it, you see,” she said. “My unhappy cousin
never knew that she was watched. The original was merely a snap-shot
taken by one of the doctors whom the King sent to Syria to visit his
mother. There was some idea that it might be necessary”&mdash;<i>possible</i>
was the word on the Princess’s tongue, but she had no intention of
revolting Cyril by an undue display of her hatred towards the woman
she had injured&mdash;“to place her under restraint, and indeed it was a
fortnight before she would consent to receive the doctors. But when
they saw her they found that violence formed no part of her disorder,
merely extreme depression, as you perceive there.”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, it is too sad for words,” returned Cyril, in the perfunctory
tone of one who finds it incumbent upon him to sympathise in a matter
for which he has no sympathy. The Princess noticed his manner with
marked satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
“Alas, Count! I have bored you. You must forgive me. My poor cousin
and I have always been such devoted friends. But tell me how you have
settled your dispute with England?”
</p>

<p>
“Without difficulty, madame. The day after my letter reached the
Duchess of Old Sarum, Mr Forfar, speaking in London, took occasion to
dissociate himself and the Government from the views expressed by Lord
Ormsea, and very soon afterwards Lord Ormsea himself, in fear of
losing his post, explained that his words were to be understood only
in a Pickwickian sense. The slight fall in Consols was so adroitly
managed that it seemed the result rather of public alarm than of a
Jewish <i>coup de main</i>, and British opinion has definitely ranged
itself on our side.”
</p>

<p>
“Good generalship usually meets with good fortune,” said the Princess,
with a smile that converted the truism into an infinitely flattering
compliment.
</p>

<p>
“You are too kind, madame. May I hope for your good wishes in the next
little difficulty that lies before me?”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed you have them, Count. But what is this new trouble?”
</p>

<p>
“I am obliged to leave for Vindobona to-morrow, madame. One of our
agents, whose name you may have heard, the scientist Texelius, has
contrived to embroil himself with the Vindobona University, and the
citizens, whose sympathies are strongly Anti-Semitic, are making a
racial question of the matter.”
</p>

<p>
“And you leave to-morrow?” said the Princess, with an irritation which
she made no attempt to conceal. “It seems quite impossible for me to
keep in touch with your movement as I was hoping to do.”
</p>

<p>
“If I might have the honour of waiting upon you on my return, madame,
it would be my delight to report such success as I may meet with. Your
wonderful sympathy and kindness&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, pray come, Count. You are not mistaken. I am deeply
interested&mdash;perhaps more than is altogether wise,” she sighed. “You
don’t know what a practical proof I have just given you of my
sympathy. I have instructed my son Kazimir to withdraw from the
candidature which was so embarrassing to you.”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, I am overwhelmed. When you graciously offered to exert your
influence on our behalf, I little dreamed of this.”
</p>

<p>
“It is a sacrifice, I don’t deny,” said the Princess, sighing again.
“With my son enthroned at Jerusalem, I should have little left to wish
for. You know that in crusading times the Kings of Jerusalem were said
to wear the crown of the world? But I felt it my duty, Count. Kazimir
is too young, too inexperienced, for such a post. He would be merely
the mouthpiece of Scythia, and I fear your poor Jews would be as badly
off as they are now. Besides,” her eyes met Cyril’s, “there is a man
who ought to be appointed, and he is not Kazimir.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas, madame, that I can exert no influence even in favour of your
candidate!”
</p>

<p>
“It is unnecessary, Count. My candidate will win the suffrages of the
Powers by virtue of his fitness for the post. Even now he would be
found, like Themistocles, second on every list. He has links uniting
him to all the Powers, but he is bound to none. He can work or fight
his way to power, as may be necessary, and it would surprise me very
much if he failed to keep what he had won.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, madame! What hope is there that so suitable a person should ever
obtain the post?”
</p>

<p>
“There is the help of friends, Count, and there is a curious condition
suggested in a letter I have just received from Pavelsburg. The
Emperor consents to withdraw the demand for an Orthodox Prince, but
insists that Orthodox influence shall be present in some form in the
new state. If the future governor were married to an Orthodox
princess, for instance, all would be well. A quaint idea is it not?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril considered the matter as gravely as if he had believed that the
Emperor was really responsible for the suggestion. “I fear, madame,
that it is only mentioned because it is impracticable,” he said. “How
could the person you speak of aspire so high?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Count, all is fair in&mdash;other fine arts as well as politics.
Hearts move faster sometimes than the pens of diplomatists.”
</p>

<p>
“True, madame, but the world has sometimes occasion to say that
presumption is rightly punished.”
</p>

<p>
“That, Count, will never be said of the man I mean. If he is willing
to be guided by me, he will leave that part of the matter in my hands.
He will continue his diplomatic campaign, and the rest is my business.
Is there any reason why he should refuse to accept the arrangement,
Count?”
</p>

<p>
“I see none, madame, unless he is a fool.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril kissed the hand held out to him, and retired. The Princess flung
the scarf contemptuously over the portrait of Queen Ernestine.
</p>

<p>
“There!” she cried, “you have done your work, and I don’t want your
miserable eyes staring at me any longer. Birnsdorf, call one of the
servants to take this thing away.”
</p>

<p>
Following on the complete success of this morning’s experiment,
however, the Princess’s plans were threatened by a danger of an
entirely unforeseen character. Her son’s withdrawal of his candidature
happened very opportunely for the Scythian Court, which was anxious to
climb down gracefully from its untenable position, in view of the
necessity for yielding to the demands of the United Nation. Still, the
opportuneness of the fact could not be allowed to stifle inquiry as to
its cause. There was something suspicious, or at any rate strange,
about the Princess of Dardania’s proceedings, and a suitable emissary
was despatched to look into them. The day after Cyril had left
Ludwigsbad for Vindobona, economising the time spent in travelling by
making notes for the letters which Mansfield, sitting opposite him,
was working off with feverish haste on the typewriter, Prince
Soudaroff arrived at the villa from the north, and requested to be
allowed to wait upon her Royal Highness. The news of his advent
paralysed the Princess with momentary dismay, but an instant’s
reflection decided her to embark upon a bold course.
</p>

<p>
“You have no bad news for me, I hope, Prince?” she asked anxiously of
the visitor, when he was ushered into her presence.
</p>

<p>
“None, madame; and I grieve to have alarmed your Royal Highness. My
reason for intruding is a vexatious delay which has interrupted our
communications. We understand that you have ordered your son to
withdraw from his Palestine candidature, but we have not yet been
informed of the reasons for your action.”
</p>

<p>
“No?” said the Princess sweetly, although this authoritative demand
for an explanation roused her ire. “But you, Prince, can have had no
difficulty in perceiving my motive?”
</p>

<p>
“I must confess with shame, madame, that your diplomacy is too deep
for me,” was the cautious reply. Prince Soudaroff thought he could
guess the motive very well, but he did not intend to exhibit his
suspicions unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
“You will make me too proud, Prince. That you should be baffled by my
little plot, and find it necessary to come to me for information!
Surely you must remember begging me to involve Count Mortimer in some
intrigue that would bring about his political ruin?”
</p>

<p>
“Naturally I remember it, madame. This step, then, is a part of the
process?”
</p>

<p>
“Undoubtedly, Prince. The unfortunate man is at this moment captivated
by the double hope of winning my affections and finding himself
appointed Governor of Palestine,” said the Princess, with a hardihood
that was nothing less than magnificent. Prince Soudaroff listened in
amazement.
</p>

<p>
“The scheme, madame, is colossal in its boldness and simplicity. How
do you propose to bring about the <i>dénoûment</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“That will be your part, I think, unless I can see my way to secure
the pleasure for myself. What do you say, Prince? Will Mortimer be
sufficiently discredited when it is known that he was intriguing for
his own advancement while posing as the disinterested friend of
Israel?”
</p>

<p>
“It would be enough for Europe, madame, and for his enemies among the
Jews; but there is a large section, with his friend the banker
Goldberg at its head, that would care nothing so long as he did not
betray them.”
</p>

<p>
“I see. Then we must think of something else. How would a secret
understanding do&mdash;say that, in consideration of a handsome sum of
money, he was to resign in favour of a Scythian Grand-Duke a month or
so after his election?”
</p>

<p>
“It is an excellent idea, madame, for the Jews would be specially
chagrined to find themselves outbidden. But permit me to ask whether
your Royal Highness intends to appear as the temptress, or as a
fellow-dupe, when the <i>dénoûment</i> comes?”
</p>

<p>
“As the temptress, of course,” replied the Princess, without a
moment’s hesitation. “I can’t resign my European reputation, even for
the sake of sparing Count Mortimer’s feelings.”
</p>

<p>
Prince Soudaroff found himself foiled. He had felt certain that the
Princess would justify his suspicions at this point, but she had stood
the test, and he had no option but to believe her. “May I ask whether
your Royal Highness’s efforts have been attended with success
hitherto?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“I cannot boast that success is absolutely secure,” she replied
thoughtfully. “Every man has his weak spot, as you know, Prince, but
with some men it is very difficult to find. It is my impression,
however, that Count Mortimer is safely landed.”
</p>

<p>
“You are not afraid that he is encouraging you in that belief for his
own purposes?” Prince Soudaroff suggested, with becoming diffidence.
</p>

<p>
The Princess’s heart uttered an indignant contradiction, but her lips
did not echo it.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know,” she said, leaning towards him confidentially, “that has
struck me more than once? ‘What if he is merely amusing himself with
me?’ I have said; but I have seen nothing, absolutely nothing, to
justify the misgiving. And I am a woman of some little experience,
Prince.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, madame, I have often envied you. Since all is secure, then,
we may go forward. The pressure of circumstances has forced us to send
orders to-day to our ambassador at Czarigrad to withdraw his
opposition to the Jewish concession. When Count Mortimer is at the
pinnacle of popularity among his friends on account of this success, I
would propose that we make public his negotiations with you.”
</p>

<p>
“Excellent, Prince! You won’t publish my name, of course? My sons
might object to that; but a few dots and dashes and asterisks would
only add to the piquancy of the affair.” In her own mind she resolved
quickly, “Then I must marry him before it is generally known that the
concession is granted. That in itself will destroy most of the effect
of the <i>exposé</i> when it comes; and as to the rest&mdash;well, I will make
him Prince of Palestine whether Scythia or any one else stands in the
way.”
</p>

<p>
“It is an unsatisfactory business,” Prince Soudaroff said to himself
as he left the villa. “Clever men have undoubtedly been beguiled by
astute women before now; but it is most unlike Mortimer. I can’t help
suspecting that he has some plot on hand. At all costs we must
anticipate him in exploding the mine.”

<p>
The news which had summoned Cyril to the Pannonian capital was
sufficiently grave. Vindobona had long held a bad pre-eminence among
the cities of Europe on account of its malignant Anti-Semitism, and
that most militant of philosophers, Dr Texelius, had managed to bring
matters to a climax at this very unpropitious moment. His feud with
the town was of old standing. Some years before, when his fame was
only beginning to spread beyond the bounds of his own seat of
learning, he had been invited to deliver a course of lectures at
Vindobona. The course was largely attended, but the students of the
University, who came to scoff and remained to howl, formed the greater
part of the audience. To lecture, save in dumb show, was impossible,
and Dr Texelius shook the dust of Vindobona from his feet, declaring
darkly that the city should yet rue the day it had insulted him. The
passage of time and the spread of his fame did not tempt him to forget
his threat, and he devised a scheme of vengeance, which he unfolded,
under a promise of secrecy, to the Chevalier Goldberg. The financier
pointed out that the plan would involve the Jews in universal odium,
and brought pressure upon him promptly to renounce it. Dr Texelius
consented, under protest, to forego his revenge, and would probably
have kept his word but for a hostile move on the part of the
University of Vindobona. The latest idea in the city was to boycott
everything that was Jewish, and in an evil hour the University
resolved to follow the fashion. A boycott was decreed forthwith
against the works of Dr Texelius, which were extensively used by the
students and professors belonging to the faculty of philosophy, and it
proved disastrously effective. The injured author rose up in his
wrath, and descended upon his foes with might and main in the columns
of a newspaper owned by the Chevalier Goldberg. No one thought of
boycotting that particular paper while the wordy war continued, for Dr
Texelius had a pretty taste in opprobrious epithets, and the whole
empire rang with the echoes of the strife. But the University remained
unaffected by the wealth of logic showered upon it. Dr Texelius might
demonstrate the iniquity, folly, illiberality, or anything else of its
conduct, but it was not in his power to bring about the removal of his
books from its Index Expurgatorins. Once convinced of this fact, the
philosopher relieved his feelings in a parting letter that outdid all
its predecessors in scurrility, and prepared to make use of more
material weapons.
</p>

<p>
Such was the state of affairs when Cyril left Ludwigsbad, summoned to
Vindobona by urgent letters from the Chevalier Goldberg, who was
alarmed by his own knowledge of what Dr Texelius had proposed to do.
Events developed rapidly during the few hours that followed, and when
Cyril reached the city he found one of the Imperial chamberlains
awaiting him on the railway platform, with a face of direful import.
</p>

<p>
“We were all in darkness last night,” he said, after a hurried
greeting.
</p>

<p>
“Then Texelius has nobbled the gas company?” asked Cyril.
</p>

<p>
The official nodded. “We of the Court should not be sorry to see the
municipality punished,” he said, “for they richly deserve it; but
there will be barricades in every street, and a massacre of the Jews,
if this goes on. The electric light is only in use in one or two
quarters.”
</p>

<p>
The situation was serious enough. The lighting of the city was in the
hands of a company, floated chiefly by means of Jewish capital, upon
the dividends of which the Anti-Semitic majority of the municipality
had for many years cast a covetous eye. An attempt to buy up the plant
and fittings by force had been foiled by appeal to the courts of law,
but the check served only to stimulate the townsmen to discover some
means of coercing the company. The plan at length adopted involved the
expenditure of an enormous sum of money, and a long course of
litigation and chicanery, but it was successful in its object of
exhausting the resources of the victims. The municipality was now in
possession of a lighting system of its own, almost in working order,
and the value of the company’s shares was rapidly approaching the
vanishing point. But the new gas supply was not yet ready for use, and
here Dr Texelius found his opportunity. When the strife first began, a
committee of the company’s shareholders had been formed for the
purpose of defending its rights, and since the majority of its members
were Jews, he had now little difficulty in persuading them to unite in
a last desperate effort. If it did not succeed in saving their
property from spoliation, it would at least incommode their enemies
seriously.
</p>

<p>
The day before that on which Cyril reached Vindobona was a holiday at
the gasworks. The furnaces were allowed to grow cold, the retorts
remained uncharged, the gas-holders empty, and as soon as the small
amount of gas in reserve had been consumed, every jet in the city,
after flickering precariously for a time, went out. Summer had passed
its prime, and the evenings were drawing in, but the heat was still
intense, and the citizens were enjoying themselves in their
brilliantly lighted public gardens. On this particular evening the
brilliance was somewhat to seek, and there were many complaints even
before the moment at which all became darkness. An Anarchist plot was
the first thought, and an irresistible panic seized the crowds of
pleasure-seekers. Some rushed wildly hither and thither, others waited
tremblingly in the stupefaction of terror. It was some time before
even the police could collect their wits sufficiently to inquire into
the mystery. At length, by the joint exercise of persuasion and moral
force, as typified by the erection of temporary lights at the
street-corners, and the employment of cavalry to disperse the crowds,
they induced the populace to seek their homes, and a commission of
inquiry was despatched post-haste to the gasworks. The explanation
afforded by the few melancholy officials in charge was a simple one.
Owing to the persistent machinations of its enemies, the company’s
dues had been withheld from it, so that it was unable to procure coal
for conversion into gas. Its whole reserve stock had been worked up,
and prompt financial aid alone could enable it to obtain more. The
honourable officials of police had better apply to the municipality.
But the municipal gasworks, the police were well aware, would not be
in working order, even if operations were carried on both day and
night, for a fortnight at least, and it was impossible to contemplate
the horror of a gas-famine lasting for that period. Hence the
appearance of the Imperial chamberlain at the station to meet Cyril
and convey him in a Court carriage to the Schloss, whither the
Chevalier Goldberg had already been summoned; and hence also the
furious mob assembled in the street outside, howling for the
destruction of the Jews and the division of their property among the
burgesses of Vindobona. Just as Cyril reached the carriage with his
conductor, his servant Dietrich, who had been looking after the
luggage, stepped up to him.
</p>

<p>
“Excellency,” he said hurriedly, “there is a riot. You cannot pass
through the streets in safety.”
</p>

<p>
“I am not deaf,” said Cyril coldly&mdash;then, turning to the chamberlain
with a smile, “My man is an old servant, and privileged, but I don’t
feel obliged to humour him in everything.”
</p>

<p>
The chamberlain was beginning to look uncomfortable, but he nodded,
and followed Cyril into the carriage. Mansfield took his place upon
the opposite seat, and they drove out of the station, to be greeted
with a storm of yells and execrations. “Traitor! renegade!” were the
epithets that saluted Cyril as soon as his clear-cut, contemptuous
profile was recognised, and the mob surged up to the carriage with
fierce shouts of rage. Those who succeeded in reaching it attempted no
actual violence, for the presence of the man who was so absolutely
unmoved by their clamour seemed to paralyse them, but those behind,
unable to catch a glimpse of the visitor, did not feel the influence
of his silent scorn. Cyril had turned to make a remark to the
chamberlain, when Mansfield sprang up with a cry, and threw himself
before him, only just in time to intercept with his shoulder a large
stone which was hurled through the window, the broken glass cutting
him about the face.
</p>

<p>
“Well done, Mansfield!” cried Cyril, while the chamberlain called
frantically to the coachman to turn and drive back again into the
station.
</p>

<p>
“You would never turn tail before a mob?” cried Cyril, roused at last.
</p>

<p>
“How should I answer to the Emperor if you were injured, Count?” was
the reply. “Besides, it is not expedient to expose the Court vehicles
to insult&mdash;and&mdash;and this brave young man’s wounds ought to be dressed.
I will merely send to the barracks in the next street for an escort of
cavalry, and we shall not be more than a few minutes.”
</p>

<p>
The station was gained in safety, and a surgeon summoned, who adorned
Mansfield’s face most artistically with strips of sticking-plaster,
much to the disgust of the victim, who persuaded himself that he could
have stanched the wounds with his handkerchief in another minute, if
that idiot had not poked his nose in. When the decoration was
complete, a troop of lancers was ready to escort the carriage, and the
progress through the streets to the Schloss was made in gallant wise,
a fence of bristling points and fluttering pennons separating the
endangered visitors from the sullen, baffled mob.
</p>

<p>
At the Schloss the elaborate rules of the ordinary etiquette were
suspended in view of the importance of the crisis, and Cyril was
conducted at once to the Emperor’s private cabinet, where he found the
Chevalier Goldberg and the Minister of the Interior. There was no time
to be lost if Pannonia was to be saved from such an outbreak of
Anti-Semitic fury as might spread all over the continent, and result
in the settlement of the Jewish question in a much more drastic manner
than was contemplated by the United Nation. The Chevalier had already
telegraphed orders, at his own risk, for large supplies of coal, which
was to be converted into gas as fast as it arrived from the various
mining districts, but this was only a temporary expedient. It did not
take long to arrange a concordat, since those assembled in council
were genuinely anxious to come to an agreement, and in less than an
hour it had been decided that a fair purchase price should be paid to
the gas company by means of a loan from the Chevalier. This was to be
guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and repaid by the municipality,
to which coercion was to be applied if necessary. Every effort was to
be made by the company to ensure the full supply of gas to the city
that night and afterwards, and any deficiency was to be supplemented
by means of a free distribution of oil to the poorer citizens. In
conclusion, pressure was to be brought to bear by the Chevalier on the
militant Dr Texelius, and he was to be ordered to leave Vindobona
within twenty-four hours. A special Imperial proclamation spread the
news of the settlement through the city, the streets were patrolled by
troops, who dispersed the mob, and before long the only crowds to be
found were in the vicinity of the railways, where they were watching
the heavily laden coal-trucks as they rolled past on their way to
discharge their load at the gasworks.
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier and Cyril were <i>personæ gratissimæ</i> at Court that day,
and the latter took advantage of the fact to accomplish another piece
of business connected with the Palestine scheme which was destined to
astonish the Princess of Dardania when she heard of it. Meanwhile, the
Chevalier presented himself as an ambassador of authority and peace at
a hastily convened meeting of the representatives of the gas company.
The members of the committee were already alarmed by the success of
their bold step, and he plunged them into a state of abject terror by
hinting at an intention on the part of the government to confiscate
the works and carry them on for the public benefit. When they had been
reduced to a sufficiently pitiable condition, he raised them suddenly
to the seventh heaven by disclosing the arrangement which had been
made, and sent them home happy in the prospect of saving something
from the wreck. Their defection cut the ground from under the feet of
Dr Texelius, who was the next person visited by the financier, and
whose only regret hitherto had been that he dared not venture into the
streets to observe the working of his revenge. His short-lived
satisfaction was ended by the peremptory order to quit Vindobona, and
he almost wished that he had not indulged in his trip to the city when
he found himself listening to the upbraidings of the Chevalier, who
charged him roundly with doing his utmost to ruin the cause of Israel.
</p>

<p>
The crestfallen philosopher was making his way on foot to the station
the next morning, shadowed at a distance by two police officers in
plain clothes, when a carriage containing two men drove past him.
Although Dr Texelius had prudently kept his name concealed, for fear
of the attentions of the populace, the mere fact that he was a Jew had
made it impossible for him to procure a cab to convey him to the
railway, and his luggage was being carried by a hanger-on of the
police. But if the inhabitants of Vindobona were unconscious of the
identity of their illustrious guest, the second secretary of the
Scythian Embassy, who was one of the occupants of the carriage, was
more fortunate.
</p>

<p>
“Look there!” he said to his companion, to whom he had been recounting
with great spirit the humours of the preceding day, “that is the
redoubtable Texelius himself. I used to see him continually when I was
in South Germany.”
</p>

<p>
“Would it be possible to express one’s sympathy with the eminent
philosopher?”
</p>

<p>
“Scarcely, Prince&mdash;in public, at least. Look at those two fellows
behind. They would have a fine story to tell if they saw you speak to
him.”
</p>

<p>
“You are right; they must not see it. Yet it would be a thousand
pities if I could not speak to him. Volodia, my dear boy, do you think
we could drive back to the station for a moment? I have unfortunately
forgotten to inquire about my train.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course&mdash;as many moments as you like.” Prince Soudaroff’s godson
knew something of his methods of working. “Am I to do anything?”
</p>

<p>
“Only watch me, and when I succeed in approaching Texelius, distract
the attention of the detectives for a second or so.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well, Prince.” The secretary was not without practice in work of
the kind, so that when Dr Texelius had finished haggling with his
porter over his charge, he found himself confronted by a dapper
gentleman, exquisitely dressed, whose grey moustache was waxed into
points of needle-like sharpness.
</p>

<p>
“I have the honour of addressing the Herr Professor Texelius?” said
the stranger hurriedly in German, laying one finger on his lips.
</p>

<p>
“I am that most shamefully ill-used man,” snorted Dr Texelius.
</p>

<p>
“You would like to expose the Mortimer?”
</p>

<p>
The philosopher’s eyes sparkled. “Only give me the chance!”
</p>

<p>
The other drew out a sealed envelope, and slipped it into his hand.
“That will provide you with the means of doing so. Hide it at once. I
am Soudaroff.”
</p>

<p>
With a dexterity which a professional conjurer might have envied, Dr
Texelius made the packet vanish up his sleeve. “It shall be done,” he
said.
</p>

<p>
“When does your paper appear?”
</p>

<p>
“The day after to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
“Let it come out then without fail. Any delay will spoil the effect.”
</p>

<p>
“It shall be inserted.”
</p>

<p>
The colloquy, which had scarcely lasted a moment, was over, and the
speakers moved apart, Prince Soudaroff to return to his godson, and Dr
Texelius to take his place in the train, chuckling with delight over
the thought that he had now the means of ruining Cyril and annoying
the Chevalier Goldberg at one blow. His revenge would draw down upon
him instant punishment from the Chevalier, he knew, but he could
afford to disregard that in the joy of the moment.
</p>

CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">“A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE.”</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> business which had called Cyril to Vindobona once ended, he
returned to Ludwigsbad with Mansfield, to find awaiting him at the
hotel a note from Princess Soudaroff, couched in very urgent terms,
and entreating him to come and see her that evening, as she was
leaving the baths the next day with Usk and Philippa.
</p>

<p>
“Do you care to come with me, Mansfield?” he asked, tossing the note
across to his secretary.
</p>

<p>
The smile of gratification which overspread Mansfield’s features at
the question disappeared with startling suddenness, for the cuts on
his face were still painful, and he murmured dolefully that he was not
fit to go anywhere.
</p>

<p>
“Didn’t know you were so keen about your personal appearance,” said
Cyril. “Nonsense! come at once.”
</p>

<p>
His objections disposed of in this summary fashion, Mansfield
submitted with the best grace in the world when Cyril took him by the
arm and fairly led him out of the house. Arrived at the gate of
Princess Soudaroff’s lodgings, the prisoner found himself suddenly
released.
</p>

<p>
“You may as well wait out here for a minute or two,” said Cyril. “I
must explain the origin of your facial adornments, and I’m afraid you
would blush yourself to death if you were listening. How many years is
it, I wonder, since I was able to blush? I’ll call you in when I have
finished.”
</p>

<p>
In this considerate intention Cyril was foiled by Usk and Philippa,
who had been watching for his approach from the verandah, and came to
meet him. Mansfield showed signs of a desire to escape, but Cyril
seized him again and explained briefly that the fellow had saved his
life, and had repented of the deed ever since. Having thus placed
matters on a right footing, he went into the house to find the
Princess, leaving the three young people together, Usk, with awestruck
face, plying Mansfield with every conceivable variety of question. As
for Philippa, the tears which threatened to overflow forbade her
speaking, but she proffered timidly such little services as occurred
to her, seating the hero in an easy-chair, and bringing him, in spite
of his protests, a cushion and a footstool. When her further
suggestions had been gratefully but firmly declined, she sat down and
gazed at him with an expression that made the young man’s heart beat
wildly.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I say, Lady Phil,” he protested incoherently; “you mustn’t make
so much of it. It wasn’t anything, really.”
</p>

<p>
“He would have been killed but for you,” persisted Philippa; “and you
are dreadfully hurt.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing but a bruise, truly; and these scratches on my face&mdash;not half
as bad as those German fellows get in their college duels. I’m ashamed
to be tied up so aggressively; but the doctor would do it.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Philippa wisely. “And you ought to be proud of your
pieces of plaster. I am.”
</p>

<p>
“No accounting for tastes,” said Usk; for Mansfield was unable to do
more than beam gratefully upon Philippa. “Did you get any chance of
paying back the chap that threw the stone, old man?”
</p>

<p>
While Mansfield was fighting the battle o’er again in answer to the
questions showered upon him, Cyril had found his way to Princess
Soudaroff’s sitting-room. The old lady looked up with a smile as he
entered. “We were expecting you,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“After the blood-curdling note you sent me, you couldn’t well do less,
Princess. Please relieve my mind as soon as possible. What is wrong?”
</p>

<p>
“It was a conversation I had with Philippa that made me send for you.
Have you noticed how unhappy she has been looking lately?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril shook his head solemnly. “Princess, Princess, if you have got a
clergyman concealed in the next room, and want me to let my secretary
marry Phil on the spot, I must tell you frankly I won’t do it. It
wouldn’t be fair to Caerleon and Nadia.”
</p>

<p>
“As though I should dream of such a thing!” Princess Soudaroff was
more nearly angry than Cyril had ever seen her. “A clandestine
marriage for my darling Phil, and under my auspices! Lord Cyril, you
should be ashamed of yourself for suggesting it. No, Philippa’s
anxiety, and mine too, is all on your account.”
</p>

<p>
“Ought I to be more flattered by your interest, or grieved for your
anxiety, Princess?”
</p>

<p>
“You are incorrigible, Lord Cyril. I assure you I am absolutely in
earnest. Phil is making herself miserable with the notion that you are
in love with the Princess of Dardania, although I have done my best to
show her its absurdity. No man who had loved Queen Ernestine, however
imperfectly, could transfer his affections to the woman who wrecked
her happiness.”
</p>

<p>
“Your sentiments are mine, Princess.”
</p>

<p>
“Then what are you doing? Your passion for the Princess has become a
by-word in her household. Even Princess Lida amused herself with it in
talking to Phil. You cannot profess to be ignorant of this, Lord
Cyril. You are not the man to drift into such a position blindfold,
and I can only judge that you have some object in pursuing this
course.”
</p>

<p>
“See what it is to have at hand a critic acquainted with all the
follies of one’s youth! I must congratulate you upon your
clear-sightedness, Princess.”
</p>

<p>
“But you and she have been enemies too long to work together with any
confidence. It must be in the hope of improving your political
position that you are trying to induce her to marry you.”
</p>

<p>
“No, Princess; there you are wrong.” Cyril spoke with a firmness that
carried conviction. “Nothing on earth could make me marry the Princess
of Dardania, or any woman in the world but Ernestine. I don’t know why
I should tell you this, except that I suspect you to be in
communication with Ernestine, and I don’t want to add to her
troubles.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you still love Ernestine?”
</p>

<p>
“I still love Ernestine&mdash;have always loved her&mdash;though I own that for
a few days I thought I should be glad never to see her again. She
thwarted me, and at the time I could think of nothing but punishing
her. I won’t cant and say that I suffered as much as she did; but when
I turned my back on her, I punished myself. The want of her has
tormented me ever since.”
</p>

<p>
“And now you are making love to her cousin!”
</p>

<p>
“I see you don’t understand me yet, Princess. I cherish a hope&mdash;a
dream, you may call it&mdash;of finding my way some day to Ernestine, and
entreating her forgiveness&mdash;her compassion. But something else must
come first.”
</p>

<p>
“And what is that?”
</p>

<p>
“The woman who separated us has to be dealt with.”
</p>

<p>
“You are deliberately deceiving the unhappy creature?”
</p>

<p>
“You will make me conceited, Princess. Is it for me to plume myself
upon having produced an impression upon the heart of her Royal
Highness?”
</p>

<p>
The Princess waived the evasion away impatiently. “You are seeking to
revenge yourself upon a woman.”
</p>

<p>
“When a woman has twice pitted her wits successfully against mine,
Princess, she is entitled to be treated as a man.”
</p>

<p>
“But who are you, to revenge yourself upon her?”
</p>

<p>
“Simply a man she has injured. I treat her as she treated Ernestine.”
</p>

<p>
“As you treated Ernestine, you mean. Your hands are no cleaner than
hers. It was your wounded ambition that enabled her to separate you
from the Queen.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t deny it, Princess. I behaved like a brute, I know&mdash;possibly
like a fool, which is worse. But she has ruined young Michael,
inflicted enormous injury upon Thracia, and hunted Ernestine
rancorously from place to place.”
</p>

<p>
“You gave her the opportunity of doing it all. And think; you speak of
returning to Ernestine. Would she wish you to avenge her wrongs in
this way?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly not; but then I don’t do it to gratify her. I tell you,
Princess, a few days ago I had almost decided to be satisfied with the
political portion of my revenge, and to forego the rest of it. Then
the woman took it into her head to boast in my presence of her cruelty
to Ernestine&mdash;to flaunt her own insolent charms in contrast with
Ernestine’s misery&mdash;intending, I suppose, to complete her conquest of
me; and I swore that she should have no mercy, since she showed none.
That is why I am going on to the bitter end.”
</p>

<p>
“But how can you expect a blessing on what you are doing?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril’s momentary fury cooled into mild impatience. “My dear Princess,
I am not in search of a blessing. What I want is revenge.”
</p>

<p>
“Think what sorrow you have brought upon Queen Ernestine already. Can
you&mdash;dare you&mdash;expose her, when your lives are linked together, to the
retribution which must follow upon this plot of yours?”
</p>

<p>
“I can bear my own punishment, Princess. It would be a singularly
unjust dispensation of Providence that visited my sins on Ernestine. I
fancy that had not occurred to you, had it?”
</p>

<p>
“Her love for you will make your punishment hers. She would not escape
it if she could. Do you forget that the Princess of Dardania is an
unscrupulous and vindictive woman? She is not likely to allow herself
to be slighted with impunity, and she may make your life with
Ernestine a misery to both of you.”
</p>

<p>
“If I succeed this time, Princess, the luck will have turned, and I am
not afraid of its turning again.”
</p>

<p>
“Lord Cyril, will nothing turn you from your purpose? I have known you
now for many years, and each time that I see you leaves a sadder
impression on my mind than the last. It seems to me that God must deal
with you very signally before you will learn to give up your own way.
I am an old woman, on the very border of the grave, and I do entreat
you, by any kindness you may have for me, by your love for Ernestine,
by the great work in which you are engaged, to relinquish this plan of
revenge.”
</p>

<p>
The old lady bent forward with clasped hands, panting in her
eagerness, her eyes fixed anxiously on Cyril’s face. He met her look
with good-humoured frankness.
</p>

<p>
“Really, Princess, I am sorry not to be able to please you. One
doesn’t often get a chance of redressing the inequalities of the world
a little, and I can’t give it up when it comes.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I feel it my duty to say that I intend to warn the Princess of
Dardania against you. I shall postpone my journey for a day, and ask
for an interview with her. I shall make no use of what you have told
me, of course; to bear of my own suspicions should serve to put her on
her guard.”
</p>

<p>
“As you please, Princess. Her Royal Highness may possibly prefer my
word to yours, after all. How can the poor old lady be so quixotic as
to show me her hand?” he asked himself as he went out. “It only means
that I must be at the villa first.”
</p>

<p>
A cipher telegram from Czarigrad was awaiting him when he returned to
his hotel. “Scythian opposition withdrawn; concession will probably be
granted in a day or two,” it ran, and Cyril smiled.
</p>

<p>
“I think that for many reasons to-morrow will be a good day for
undeceiving her Royal Highness, and possibly for electrifying the
world,” he said to himself, all unconscious that Dr Texelius had
already prepared the way for both processes, by means of the
indictment so considerately drawn up by Prince Soudaroff.
</p>

<p>
When Cyril repaired to the villa early the next day, he was ushered
into the great drawing-room, which he found deserted, almost for the
first time in his experience. The servant who had admitted him went to
seek Countess Birnsdorf, but had no sooner closed the door behind him
than Cyril heard the Countess’s voice in the inner room.
</p>

<p>
“The Princess Soudaroff is very anxious to wait upon you, madame.”
</p>

<p>
“What, that old heretic?” Like other converts, the Princess was
inclined to be more orthodox than the Orthodox themselves. “I don’t
want to listen to her sermons. She hopes to convert me, I suppose? No,
Birnsdorf, I won’t see her.”
</p>

<p>
“I think, madame, that her only wish is to express her thanks for your
kindness to her god-daughter, Lady Philippa.”
</p>

<p>
“That is quite unnecessary. I sent a message to her by the girl,
requesting her not to give herself the trouble. I can’t stand these
psalm-singing Evangelicals, although I tolerated little Philippa for
the sake of&mdash;her family.” Cyril smiled, gathering from this remark
that the household at the villa had found Philippa’s society as little
congenial as she had found theirs.
</p>

<p>
“The lady is very old, madame,” ventured the Countess, “and she seems
extremely desirous to see you. She entreated me&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I tell you, Birnsdorf, I won’t see her. What impertinence! Tell her
that I am engaged&mdash;that I am always engaged at this hour. As though I
should put off Count Mortimer for the sake of receiving her! Didn’t
you say you saw him coming? Bring him in, if he has arrived.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril had moved noiselessly to the farther side of the drawing-room
before Countess Birnsdorf lifted the curtain that hung over the
doorway. He caught the look of annoyance on her face as she realised
that the door between the two rooms was open, but he met her with an
expression so absolutely unmoved as enabled her to comfort herself
with the assurance that he could not have heard anything.
</p>

<p>
“Her Royal Highness will receive you, Count,” she said, and the
Princess looked up with a very natural start as he passed under the
curtained doorway. She was reading a newspaper, which Cyril recognised
immediately as the ‘Jewish Colonist,’ a journal conducted by Dr
Texelius in German and Jargon, to promote the agricultural and
commercial development of Palestine, and its re-population by the
Hebrew race. It was not quite the kind of paper one would expect to
find in the hands of a great lady of rigidly Orthodox views, but there
could be no doubt that the Princess was deeply interested in it.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, are you come to scathe me with bitter reproaches?” she
cried, looking up from the closely printed page.
</p>

<p>
“Alas, madame! your conscience must have outrun my just indignation. I
was not even aware I had been injured until now.”
</p>

<p>
“What a misfortune it is to be in too great a hurry!” cried the
Princess. “I thought, of course, that you had heard of my treachery
from our friend here, and were come to denounce me. There is no hope
of hiding it from you now.”
</p>

<p>
She handed him the paper, which displayed in a conspicuous position
the announcement that it would appear no more under its present
editorship. An editorial note explained that Dr Texelius, aware that
his independent course was distasteful to the proprietor of the
journal, felt it his duty to throw up his post and wreck the paper.
His position thus indicated, the editor proceeded to business. He had
always, he said, doubted the disinterestedness of Count Mortimer, but
he had forborne to ventilate his suspicions until accident had shown
them to be entirely justified. The man who posed as the high-minded
friend of Israel was merely a vulgar schemer, seeking to exploit the
greatest movement of the age for his own benefit. His ambition had led
him to lend a ready ear to the blandishments of Scythia, the natural
enemy of Zion, and he had fallen victim to the wiles of a Delilah
hired to entrap him. While deceiving his unfortunate supporters, he
had been deceived himself. The post of Governor of Palestine had been
promised him, together with the hand of his enchantress, as the price
of his care of Scythian interests throughout the negotiations, and in
consideration of a large sum of money he was to resign his position in
favour of a Scythian nominee immediately after his election. There had
never been the slightest intention of keeping faith with him, however.
The lady, whose identity was not obscurely hinted at, had held him in
play as long as he was useful, only to cast him aside when she had
done with him. He had betrayed Jewish interests in vain, and now that
it suited Scythia to throw him over, he stood revealed in all his
baseness as a faithless agent and an unsuccessful traitor. Through
this indictment, couched in terms which did not err on the side of
refinement, Cyril glanced carelessly, and, having read it, handed it
back to the Princess.
</p>

<p>
“Well, what have you to say?” she asked him.
</p>

<p>
“I am utterly at a loss, madame. I have nothing to say.”
</p>

<p>
“What, Count! you don’t even feel called upon to testify the slightest
sorrow for the way in which my name is involved in your
proceedings?&mdash;for it is impossible for any one not to see who is
meant.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, madame, my assailant has displayed a scrupulous regard for your
feelings. You are the conqueror throughout, not the victim.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you accept the <i>rôle</i> of victim, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Even so, madame. What can I do but acknowledge your triumph and ask
your gracious leave to retire? A discredited traitor is no fit
associate for your Royal Highness.”
</p>

<p>
“Stop, Count! You have carried on this farce long enough. Why pretend
to take the man’s nonsense seriously? You know as well as I do that
whoever may have been deceived, you were not.”
</p>

<p>
“What, madame! Are you trying to restore my lost self-esteem! to
re-establish your empire over me, according to Dr Texelius?” Cyril was
smiling.
</p>

<p>
“Pray, Count, be serious. What is the object of raising a new barrier
between us at this moment, when this kind enemy of yours has
unintentionally broken them all down? The hero and heroine occupy the
stage, every eye is fixed upon them, and the stupid audience, which
thinks it has followed the play with the deepest attention,
anticipates what it imagines to be the <i>dénoûment</i>. But it is
mistaken, for it has failed to see what was before its eyes. The true
<i>dénoûment</i> is the simplest, the most unconventional possible&mdash;all
honour to the actors who have grafted it on so hackneyed a plot.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear I am very dense, madame. Am I to understand that you and I
have been acting some comedy for the edification of the spectators? or
should it be a tragedy?”
</p>

<p>
“Why play upon words, Count? A tragedy is what the audience expected,
undoubtedly, for the fall of a great man is far more tragic than his
death, but the slightest possible alteration in the original <i>motif</i>
makes a happy ending not only natural, but inevitable.”
</p>

<p>
“My stupidity is colossal, madame. Might I venture to entreat you to
point out to me the alteration to which you refer?”
</p>

<p>
“Are you trying to tease me, Count? The audience saw only a pair of
politicians, each striving to outwit the other. But on the stage were
a man and woman playing into each other’s hands.”
</p>

<p>
“With reference to what, madame?”
</p>

<p>
“You are indeed dense, my dear Count.” There was some irritation in
the Princess’s tone. “You force me to speak with disagreeable
plainness. They were playing for a crown and a ring. But why this
extraordinary display of ignorance in a matter you have discussed with
me for weeks?”
</p>

<p>
“It seems to me, madame, that one of the actors on the stage was under
the same delusion as the audience. Would it suit your Royal Highness
to drop metaphor for a moment, and let us see how we stand?”
</p>

<p>
The Princess was genuinely puzzled. She lifted her eyes to Cyril’s
face, but discovered there no response to her smile. Was it possible
that the man had misunderstood her from the beginning? No, it was
merely that he was cautious, he would not commit himself without
specific encouragement. “You cannot have forgotten our compact
already?” she cried merrily.
</p>

<p>
“I was not aware that there was any compact between us, madame.”
</p>

<p>
The Princess began to perceive whither all this tended. “Not that I
was to make you Prince of Palestine? and you&mdash;&mdash;” she stopped
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Far from it, madame. My hopes have never climbed so high.”
</p>

<p>
Horror was taking hold upon her, but she was still unconquered. “Let
them make the effort, then, Count. Otherwise Europe will see you as
the traitor this journalist calls you. You are too deeply involved to
draw back with honour. I hold your reputation in my hands, and Prince
Soudaroff is behind me. Choose! Safety and&mdash;&mdash;” she touched the
wedding-ring on her finger, “or&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Evidently, madame, you are unaware that I have just recommended the
Emperor of Pannonia to nominate Prince Franz Immanuel of
Schwarzwald-Molzau as his candidate for the post&mdash;one of the
posts&mdash;you are good enough to offer me. His religious opinions are so
truly liberal&mdash;for in view of the uncertainty as to his future he has
been brought up on an admirably eclectic system, so as to be ready for
any country that may need a king&mdash;that he seems the very man for it.”
</p>

<p>
The vague terror which had seized the Princess became certainty. Her
face hardened, her lips grew tense, and her right hand went swiftly to
her head. Cyril understood the movement. The peasant-girls of Dardania
carry in their hair a silver-hilted dagger as a part of their
elaborate head-dress, and the Princess had worn the national costume
constantly before her widowhood. He wondered mechanically whether she
had contrived to retain the weapon under the folds of her cap, and if
so, how many seconds he had to live. Almost before the thought had
crossed his mind, however, the hand dropped again, empty. The dagger
was not there. The Princess pointed silently to the door, and he bowed
and retreated. Her voice arrested him before he reached the threshold.
</p>

<p>
“Why have you done this?” she demanded passionately. “Oh, I know&mdash;I
have not forgotten your threat to revenge yourself on me. But that I
should have been deceived by you&mdash;I!”
</p>

<p>
She sat for a moment without speaking, then rose and came towards him.
</p>

<p>
“Come, Count, you have had your revenge, and enjoyed it, no doubt. You
had a right to it, I will confess, so let it pass. We are quits now.
Why not start afresh? Purely as a matter of business, don’t you think
you are very foolish to quarrel with me? You and I together could do
anything we chose. What is the use of pitting our wits continually
against each other? You know what I can do for you&mdash;you have no
prospects otherwise. Let us blot out the last quarter of an hour. Why
should not our compact remain in force? What do you say?” She laid her
hand upon his arm, and behind her honeyed smile a passionate eagerness
shone in her eyes and trembled upon her lips. Many men would have
succumbed to the temptation of the woman and what she offered. Not so
Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“I can only repeat, madame, that I know of no compact.”
</p>

<p>
She drew back from him and stood erect. “Then there is some other
woman,” she said, absolute certainty in her voice. “Is it Ernestine?”
</p>

<p>
“It is Ernestine.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish you joy, then. Go!”
</p>

<p>
She pointed again to the door, and he went out, conscious that she
would have sold her soul for a weapon ready to her hand, and that if
wishes could kill, neither Ernestine nor he would live much longer. In
the excitement of the moment the Princess had ordered him out by the
private door at the back of the boudoir, instead of that opening into
the large drawing-room. As he entered the anteroom a female figure
quitted it hastily by the opposite door, and the Scythian Captain
Roburoff tried to look as if he had been alone for some hours.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Roburoff, you here?” said Cyril, nodding to him.
</p>

<p>
“Simply on an errand for his Majesty, Count. I was the bearer of a
letter to her Royal Highness.”
</p>

<p>
“And you were tempering duty with pleasure when I came in?”
</p>

<p>
The Scythian’s face darkened. “Do you&mdash;would you insult&mdash;pray
consider, Count&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“My dear fellow, we were all young once, even ladies-in-waiting. I
wish you an uninterrupted interview next time.”
</p>

<p>
“All the same,” murmured Cyril, as he quitted the villa by the private
door, leaving Captain Roburoff reassured, “I am much mistaken if the
young lady was not Princess Lida, and not a <i>dame d’honneur</i> at all. I
fear there are further troubles in store for my poor friend the
Princess; but after thrusting King Michael back upon the unhappy girl
once already, I really can’t bring myself to spoil her plans a second
time. I wonder how long they have been carrying on this affair?”
</p>


<h3 id="ch09">
CHAPTER IX.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">VERSIONS DIFFER.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">Birnsdorf</span>!” said the Princess.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer. Truth to tell, poor Countess Birnsdorf was dozing
in an uncomfortable high-backed chair in the great drawing-room, where
she had remained during Cyril’s interview with her mistress, after
delivering a softened version of the latter’s message to Princess
Soudaroff. Her knitting and her spectacles were left behind in the
anteroom beyond the boudoir, where Captain Roburoff was improving the
shining hour in a way that would have made her hair stand on end had
she known of it, and the low murmur of voices from the intervening
room had lulled her to sleep. The imperious tone in which the Princess
repeated her summons reached her ears, however, and she made her
appearance, full of apologies, at the inner door. The Princess was
sitting at the table, her head supported pensively upon her hand.
</p>

<p>
“If Count Mortimer should present himself here again, Birnsdorf,
remember that I will not receive him,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“No, madame?” hazarded the Countess, consumed with curiosity. It was
evident that the crisis which every member of the household had been
anticipating, although the Princess had apparently been blind to its
approach, had come; but how, and with what result?
</p>

<p>
“He would scarcely venture to show himself,” pursued the Princess,
meditatively, “but one can never tell. And exciting scenes of the kind
are too much for me. Positively, I cannot stand them. I am too
tender-hearted.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, madame, it has made you look frightfully ill.” Countess
Birnsdorf was horrified by the strained paleness of her mistress’s
face. “You will permit me to summon a physician? No?” Then, her
indignation increasing as the Princess shook her head with the smile
of a martyr, “I could never have believed that Count Mortimer would
forget himself so far as to persist in a conversation disagreeable to
your Highness, even if he had the bad taste to enter upon it.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, when these self-restrained men have once lost control of
themselves, there is no holding them. Did you see the poor man go out,
Birnsdorf?”
</p>

<p>
“No, madame. I am certain he did not pass through the drawing-room.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, of course. I allowed him to escape by the private stair. One
does not wish to subject to public humiliation a man who is already
unhappy, even though it is by his own fault.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, madame, in presence of your angelic kindness, I do not wonder
that the unhappy nobleman forgot himself.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense, Birnsdorf! You are a sad flatterer,” with pathetic
sweetness. “Where is Lida?”
</p>

<p>
“I believe her Highness is walking in the gardens with Mlle.
Delacroix, madame,” replied the Countess, with a perceptible sniff.
The elderly Frenchwoman who had been Princess Lida’s governess, and
was now her chosen confidant, played the part of Mordecai to Countess
Birnsdorf’s Haman.
</p>

<p>
“Beg her to come to me when she returns to the house. I have something
important to say to her.” The lady-in-waiting departed, and the
Princess, finding herself alone, threw aside the mask for a moment.
Her right hand clenched itself involuntarily, the left was pressed
upon her heart as she rose and paced the room.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” she said to herself, “I will be prudent. I cannot afford to
fail again. Lida must be safely married, or I shall lose my only
chance of returning to power. I must have some standing-ground from
which to move my world&mdash;a recognised position in some country or
other. But as soon as I am sure of my footing&mdash;then, Count, look to
yourself! You shall not return to Ernestine. You may scorn me if you
like, but she shall not have you. I will track you step by step when
you try to slink back to her, and, when you think you have won her, I
will come between you. I can tell her a few little truths that will
place you in a new light, my dear Count!”
</p>

<p>
She laughed mirthlessly, and returned with a swift step to her seat at
the table as she heard her daughter crossing the anteroom. There was a
pretty mixture of triumph and girlish timidity in Princess Lida’s
manner as she came into the room, and her shining eyes and
rose-flushed cheeks were eloquent of shy happiness. At any other time
her mother’s eagle glance would have perceived the change immediately,
but now the Princess was too much engrossed with her own thoughts to
observe it.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Lida!” she said. “I wanted to tell you that I think it advisable
to hasten on your wedding a little. It will be a year next month since
your father died, and there is no reason why you should not be married
the month after.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, mamma!” faltered Princess Lida, in dire dismay. “Michael is such
a boy,” she explained, recovering herself.
</p>

<p>
“He will be nineteen then. Many kings have been younger when they
married.”
</p>

<p>
“But he is so&mdash;so disagreeable. You know, when I have complained to
you of his behaviour, you have always said he would undergo a change
and become quite different before we were married; but he hasn’t done
anything of the kind yet. Lately he has been worse than ever.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, you will have the pleasure of superintending his reformation
yourself. You are not the girl I think you if you can’t make him treat
you with proper respect.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I am not afraid of that.” Princess Lida raised her dark head
proudly. “But, mamma, I don’t see any reason for being in such a
hurry. I don’t care to be married just yet.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear child, you talk as if you had only to hold up your finger and
Michael would come whenever you chose to claim him. But that is not
the case. He would be little Philippa’s bridegroom now if she would
have taken him.”
</p>

<p>
“I only wish she had!”
</p>

<p>
“Lida, this is childish. Michael can give you a crown, and you don’t
find crowns hanging on every bush. The eligible princes of Europe are
not contending for the light of your <i>beaux yeux</i>, my dear&mdash;far from
it. You must take what you can get, or you will end by getting
nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s very hard,” pouted Princess Lida, “that the only person I can
get should be so horrid. Bettine had no trouble of this kind. Look how
devoted Albrecht is to her.”
</p>

<p>
“I know he is, my dear child; but that can’t be helped. Bettine’s
marriage was arranged for her just as yours was, and we could not tell
how differently Michael and Albrecht would turn out. Of course
circumstances were more favourable at the time of her wedding. Your
father’s death, and your brother’s unkind behaviour in depriving us of
a home, place us in a difficult position at present, and Michael does
not show the consideration he might. But for your comfort, Lida, I
will say this. Michael is one of the most pliable men I know, if you
take him the right way. Once get rid of his present companions, and
make yourself necessary to him, and he will be your devoted slave as
long as you take care not to pull the chain too tight.”
</p>

<p>
“I should like to snap it at once. I don’t want to marry him. Mamma,
you married for love, didn’t you?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Lida!” The Princess was shocked. “Who has been talking to you
of such things? You have picked up a wrong idea, of course. What
really happened was only that when my father chose to turn against the
lover whom he had himself recommended to me, I did not.”
</p>

<p>
“I knew that was it! And you married him?”
</p>

<p>
“I did; but then, you see, we had been allowed to fall in love with
one another. I have taken care that there should be no complication of
the sort in your case.”
</p>

<p>
“But Bettine and Albrecht love one another.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear child, pray don’t cavil. I mean, of course, that I have taken
care you should have no chance of falling in love with any one but the
man you are to marry.”
</p>

<p>
“But he doesn’t love me.”
</p>

<p>
“You are becoming a little tiresome, Lida. There were unfortunate
circumstances which obliged me to hasten on your betrothal before
Michael had perceived the nature of his feeling for you, and unhappily
he resents being bound, as he considers it. But I have already said
that you will be able to set things right as soon as you are married,
if you go the right way to work.”
</p>

<p>
“But, mamma, you say you were right in disobeying your father because
it was for your lover’s sake. If I had a lover, mamma&mdash;&mdash;?” She came
forward a little with clasped hands, and her eyes rested entreatingly
on her mother’s face. The Princess laughed coldly.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t imagine impossibilities, my dear child. You have no
lover&mdash;could not have one without my knowledge, and I have no
intention of allowing you such a luxury. You will marry Michael two
months hence, and I shall write to him to-day to make arrangements.
The letter will take some time, for I must be careful how I put
things. That equerry of his had better wait until to-morrow before
returning, Czartoriski and he must amuse one another.”
</p>

<p>
“We were thinking of a ride this afternoon,” suggested Princess Lida
meekly. Her mother nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
“That will do very well. By the bye, Lida, if you should come across
Count Mortimer, you need not speak to him. Bow, of course, but nothing
more.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, mamma. Has he done anything?” Princess Lida’s eyes were dancing.
</p>

<p>
“Count Mortimer has thought fit to lose sight of the difference
between his position and mine, and address me in a very strange way.
That is all.”
</p>

<p>
It was enough for Princess Lida, who never dreamt of regarding Cyril
as anything but an unhappy victim of her mother’s charms. She told the
story with great glee to Mlle. Delacroix, and Mlle. Delacroix retailed
it to a compatriot who was visiting the baths. Since every one at
Ludwigsbad takes a childlike and unabashed interest in every one
else’s affairs, it was known by the evening from one end of the little
town to the other that Count Mortimer had conceived a romantic
adoration for the Princess of Dardania&mdash;and had declared it to its
object! Coming so soon after the revelations put forth by Dr Texelius,
the story met with instant and universal acceptance, and there were
only a few people who remarked that Count Mortimer must have been
playing for very high stakes when he allowed himself to appear such a
fool. Mansfield had been spending the afternoon at one of the
shooting-galleries, where the gilded youth of both sexes were wont to
consume much valuable time in massacring little wooden soldiers by
means of air-guns. Here he heard the tale, and returned to the hotel
with a settled gloom on his countenance such as even the fact of
Philippa’s departure had been insufficient to produce.
</p>

<p>
“Why so sad, gentle youth?” asked Cyril, catching sight of his face.
</p>

<p>
“They are saying all over the place that the Princess of Dardania
has&mdash;has given you the sack, Count,” said Mansfield tragically.
</p>

<p>
“They are&mdash;are they? Really there’s something positively demoniacal
about that woman’s cleverness! And you, Mansfield, you&mdash;try to comfort
me in my misery with the assurance that my sad plight is known all
over the town!”
</p>

<p>
“It’s not true?” burst from Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“Since the Princess has spread the report, she must intend it to be
believed. Is it for me to contradict a lady? Rather let me study how
best to corroborate her assertion. I must go to dinner in a Norfolk
jacket, I suppose, and neglect my appearance generally. If Dietrich
could only be induced to forget to shave me! But perhaps it would be
just as effective if I let my moustache droop for a day or two. What
do you say, Mansfield? You will look disconsolate too, of course&mdash;in
fact, you are doing it already&mdash;but you will wear your rue with a
difference. The Confidant is only allowed to go mad in white linen,
you know. Tilburina’s white satin must be reserved for me.”
</p>

<p>
“But the Princess has given orders that you are to be refused
admission if you try to see her.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, that’s what is afflicting you, is it? Make your mind easy; I have
no intention whatever of trying to see the Princess.”
</p>

<p>
“But will you let her go on spreading these lies about you?”
</p>

<p>
“Why not, if it pleases her? They are telling worse lies about me all
over Europe, and it does me no harm. You and the Chevalier Goldberg
seem to take these things to heart much more than I do. By the bye,
mind you show up when the Chevalier arrives to-morrow. He wants to
speak to you.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier’s reason for wishing to see Mansfield was made clear on
his arrival the next day, when the unwilling secretary found himself
invested with a gold watch and chain of surpassing magnificence. The
watch was decorated with an inscription to the effect that it was a
slight token of admiration and gratitude for Mansfield’s bravery in
saving Count Mortimer’s life, and the chain carried a small fortune in
the way of charms, which puzzled the recipient not a little. The
Chevalier had originally intended his testimonial of gratitude to take
the form of a diamond ring of the size and lustre commonly seen only
on South African mine-owners and the monarchs of high finance, but on
consulting Cyril he found that such an ornament in Mansfield’s
possession would never see the light of day, and with reluctance chose
instead the best watch that money could buy. He had taken a great
fancy to Mansfield, purely on Cyril’s account, and he dismissed him
now with an assurance of future favour which would have driven one of
his own nation wild with joy. Mansfield, who was English, and failed
to appreciate properly the power which the Chevalier possessed in
right of his millions, received the promise without any particular
emotion, and went out for a mountain walk. Left alone together, the
Chevalier and Cyril turned their attention to business. They spoke in
English, for the Chevalier was proud of his proficiency in that
language, and liked to keep himself in practice.
</p>

<p>
“Well, have you come to tell me that I am the best-execrated man in
Europe?” asked Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“If dere was such noose to tell you, I would not be de men to do it,”
was the quick response. “No, my frient, de storm is passed ofer your
head like water off a duck’s beck.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled involuntarily. “This is extremely gratifying, Chevalier.
You think Texelius has overreached himself, then?”
</p>

<p>
“Undoubtedly. You know he was placed on de board off manachement off
de United Nation? Well, de directors met yesterday, and expelled him,
solely on account of his atteck on you.”
</p>

<p>
“But that was purely your doing, of course.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all. Dere were some det took your side from de first, and de
rest came ofer to it ess soon ess dey heard off your confersation wid
de Emperor about Prince Franz Immanuel. Dey saw at once det you hed
been foolink de Scythians all de time dey thought dey were foolink
you, and det it was not you, but de mysterious lady, who hed been
deceifed in de metter.”
</p>

<p>
“But how did the Franz Immanuel business come out?”
</p>

<p>
“I saw to det, my frient. Dere was an inspired paragreph in all de
Findobona papers yesterday which related de fects.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry you did that, Chevalier. If the proposal has become
public, it means that there is no hope of getting it adopted.”
</p>

<p>
“Dere nefer wass any,” said the Chevalier calmly. “I hed sent an
achent to sound de Prince’s parents, and dey would not hear off his
goink to Pelestine. Dey mean him to merry de young Queen of Frisia.”
</p>

<p>
“Another check!” cried Cyril. “I thought we were on firm ground at
last. Then my journey to Vindobona was all for nothing?”
</p>

<p>
“By no means, Count. De proposal may hef failed, but at least it safed
you first. It was so netural and so suitable det no one could beliefe
de story off Texelius. Herschel Rubenssohn, whom I met passink through
Vindobona, hess written a great article on de subchect in my paper,
which I hef wid me, and you shell see it. Transferrink his republican
fiews to you, he says det de nobility off your cheracter and aims
would prefent you from efer dessirink to make yourself a prince.”
</p>

<p>
“It is dangerous to dogmatise,” said Cyril gravely. “If Palestine was
offered me by a unanimous vote of the Powers, I fear all Mr
Rubenssohn’s pledges on my behalf would not make me refuse it.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier smiled, but wistfully. “Ah, my frient, why were you not
born a prince&mdash;efen a Cherman princelink?” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Probably because Europe would have been too small to hold me. Now,
pray, Chevalier, no hankering after impossibilities.”
</p>

<p>
“You might efen now become a confert to Rome, and buy a dukedom from
de Fatican,” suggested the financier, with the uneasy smile of a man
experimenting on the edge of a slumbering volcano. “De money iss et
your serfice, and wid de Chews supportink you on one side and de
Chesuits on de oder, not efen Scythia could hope to keep you out of
Pelestine.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, if I could take you over to Rome with me, there might be
something in the idea,” responded Cyril instantly. “The Goldberg
millions would be welcome indeed at the Papal Court. But without
them&mdash;&mdash; No, Chevalier, it won’t do. And what has happened to
Texelius?”
</p>

<p>
“He retains de direction off de colonisink scheme, but he hess lost
his influence in our cheneral councils,” replied the Chevalier,
accepting the change of subject obediently and gratefully. “Det will
allow Koepfle to come to de front&mdash;a better men off business, dough
widout de European lustre off Texelius, and one det hess nefer yet
receifed de full recognition he desserfes. It was from an idea off his
det I gained de first notion off foundink our Syndicate, in order to
help to completion de schemes he hed outlined. We shell do better now
den before, I think.”
</p>

<p>
“When do you expect to get your concession?” asked Cyril suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Fery soon,” replied the Chevalier. “It may be two&mdash;three days, det
iss all.”
</p>

<p>
“And when you have got it, you will have no need of me for a month or
so? I want a holiday. A trip to Syria would do me good, I think.”
</p>

<p>
“To Syria? to Pelestine, you mean. Ah, my frient, you hef a plen! You
will not hide it from me? De Goldberg millions are all et your
serfice. You intend to make yourself master off de Land by a <i>coup de
main</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Chevalier, I don’t intend anything of the kind. I am quite in
earnest in saying that the governorship is out of my reach. My visit
would be purely private and unofficial. You may call it a pilgrimage
if you like, although the saint whose shrine I have in view is alive
and not dead.”
</p>

<p>
“You would not deceife your frient?&mdash;dough I shell not be engry if I
hear you hef esteblished yourself dere. I know your prudence, Count.
But you will not be lonk away? Our affairs in Europe will go to ruin
widout you.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t expect to be long, but it depends on the success I may meet
with. If others get before me, I shall have a poor chance. But
business first, Chevalier. If you need me in Europe, I won’t go.”
</p>

<p>
“My frient, if dis fissit iss for your adfantache or pleassure, you
shell go whatefer heppens. Dere iss always the telegreph by which I
may consult you.”
</p>

<p>
In the fulness of his generosity, the Chevalier proceeded to develop a
plan by which a staff of operators with a field telegraph were to
follow Cyril from place to place, so as to keep him always in touch
with the European headquarters of the Jewish movement. His schemes
were interrupted by the arrival of a telegram in cipher, which he read
to Cyril with triumph in his tones: “Czarigrad. You are wanted here.
Concession will probably issue to-morrow or next day.”
</p>

<p>
“It iss well,” said the Chevalier. “To-night I leafe for Czarigrad. I
return wid de concession, den you start for Pelestine. One
confersation we must hef first, to settle our line off ection in
future.”
</p>

<p>
“All right,” said Cyril, and the financier departed. On his return
from his walk, the astonished Mansfield was desired to hold himself in
readiness for a journey to Syria, which might become necessary at any
time within the next month. No explanation was given, but he
attributed the probable necessity to the business of the Syndicate,
and having made his preparations, awaited placidly the summons to
start.

CHAPTER X.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">TAKING COUNSEL WITH BABES.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">On</span> the third morning after the departure of the Chevalier, Mansfield
was sitting writing in the anteroom at the hotel, when the garden door
opened violently, and an elderly lady hurried up to the house.
Mansfield thought she was a <i>Kurgäste</i> who had lost her way, for she
was wrapped in a loose cloak, and had a lace scarf thrown over her
head, in the style affected early in the day by ladies who were taking
the waters. On going to the door, he was astonished to find himself
face to face with Countess Birnsdorf, in a state of violent
excitement.
</p>

<p>
“Where is Count Mortimer?” she cried, trying to push past him. “I
insist on seeing him immediately.”
</p>

<p>
“I will find out whether his Excellency is able to see you, Countess,”
said Mansfield, holding his ground. “He may be engaged.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, then he is here? Then I am not too late!” and the old lady sank
down upon a bench and broke into gasping sobs. “Oh, Mr Secretary, let
me see him. I must see him, I tell you!”
</p>

<p>
Surprised and perplexed, Mansfield knocked at Cyril’s door. “Countess
Birnsdorf is here, Count, and says she must see you. She is in a
terrible state about something,” he added, stepping inside the room.
</p>

<p>
“What can be the matter now?” said Cyril. “Some trick of the
Princess’s, I suppose. Well, you had better ask her in.”
</p>

<p>
Before Mansfield could obey, the Countess, her suspicions roused by
his closing the door behind him, forced her way in. For an instant she
stared wildly round the room and incredulously at Cyril, then flung
herself at his feet.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Count, give her back to us! Where is she? What have you done with
her&mdash;my little Princess? She never did you any harm. You may cherish a
grudge against her mother, but have you the heart to revenge yourself
on the child?”
</p>

<p>
“Calm yourself, Countess,” said Cyril, so gently that the old lady
choked back her sobs and allowed him to raise her and lead her to a
seat. “What has happened to the Princess? I don’t understand you.”
</p>

<p>
“She is gone,” sobbed Countess Birnsdorf, “and so is the Frenchwoman,
her attendant. No one saw them leave the house, and there is not so
much as a note to say where they are gone. As soon as the poor
Princess&mdash;her mother&mdash;heard the awful news, she said, ‘This is Count
Mortimer’s doing. He is taking his revenge on me,’ and I threw on a
cloak and ran all the way here in the hope of softening your heart
before it was too late.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas, Countess, I cannot tell you where the Princess is,” said Cyril.
“But let us consider what we can do to obtain news of her Highness.
You did not intend to speak before my secretary, did you? Mr
Mansfield, please see that this visit is not mentioned.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield retired, and finding in the garden the old man-servant who
had accompanied Countess Birnsdorf, told him to wait in Paschics’s
room, lest his livery should be recognised by the hotel servants.
Scarcely had he returned to his writing when footsteps upon the path
announced a second visitor. This time the intruder was Colonel
Czartoriski, a white-moustached veteran of many fights, and master of
the household to the Princess of Dardania.
</p>

<p>
“Where is your master, young man?” he inquired, looking Mansfield over
in a peculiarly irritating way.
</p>

<p>
“Count Mortimer is in his office,” returned Mansfield curtly,
resenting the style of address.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, indeed! Then I wish to see him.”
</p>

<p>
“Unfortunately you can’t. His Excellency is engaged.”
</p>

<p>
“So early?” very mildly. “I am indeed unfortunate. Who is with him,
may I ask?”
</p>

<p>
“A lady.”
</p>

<p>
Colonel Czartoriski’s face became livid. “And you venture to
acknowledge that to me?” he roared. “Who is the lady?”
</p>

<p>
“I am not at liberty to mention her name.”
</p>

<p>
“Out of the way, young man! Let me pass.”
</p>

<p>
“Gently,” said Mansfield, shifting the old soldier adroitly from the
inner door. “I don’t know what you mean by coming here and behaving as
if you were in a comic opera, but it won’t take much more to make me
kick you down the steps.”
</p>

<p>
Colonel Czartoriski’s hand went promptly to the place where his
sword-hilt was wont to be, but remembering that he was in plain
clothes, he repressed his wrath, and made a gallant effort to be calm.
</p>

<p>
“I ask your pardon, young sir. If you knew the reason for my
excitement, you would excuse it, but you have not, I am sure, fathomed
the full villainy of your master’s character. No,” as Mansfield made a
threatening movement, “I will not speak against him. I ask you only to
risk his displeasure for a moment for the sake of the honour of an
august family, and the future of an unfortunate and misguided young
lady.”
</p>

<p>
“What do you want me to do?” asked Mansfield, unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
“You see my position?” Colonel Czartoriski turned to the wall, and
stood with his face almost touching a map of Western Asia which he
appeared to be studying. “I give you my word of honour that I will
maintain this attitude while you approach the lady, and entreat her to
return immediately with her attendant to the home she has forsaken. I
will not move until she is outside the garden, when I will venture to
attend her back to the villa. I shall not have seen her here, you are
a young man of honour and will not speak, the world will only know of
an early walk. Come, you will help me to save her?”
</p>

<p>
“I am sure you are making some mistake about the lady,” said
Mansfield, in much perplexity; but he approached the door of Cyril’s
study, reaching it just as the owner opened it to escort Countess
Birnsdorf to the gate. The old lady’s cry of surprise on catching
sight of him made Colonel Czartoriski forget his promise and turn
round, and both looked unutterably guilty.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose,” said Cyril, “that I ought to feel flattered at your both
regarding me as such a Lothario; but I assure you the honour is quite
undeserved.”
</p>

<p>
“It was the words the Princess used,” explained Countess Birnsdorf,
apologetically. “A mother’s instinct&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid her Royal Highness’s instincts are not to be trusted
where I am concerned. This is not the first rumour she has set afloat
about me, you will remember.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you intend to impute malice to her Highness, Count?” demanded
Colonel Czartoriski hotly.
</p>

<p>
“By no means, Colonel. I merely state a fact.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Countess Birnsdorf, unaware of the admission she was
making. “How can you try to pick a quarrel with the Count, Colonel,
when he may have given us a clue to our poor Princess’s flight? If you
will make inquiries about Captain Roburoff’s destination when he left
this place three days ago, while I go home to try and calm her
Highness’s mind, it may help us a little.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, if Captain Roburoff has acted as Count Mortimer’s deputy&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“The Count once saw him talking to Princess Lida, that’s all. But if
you go on wasting time like this, how are we to save her? Come, come,”
and Countess Birnsdorf hurried the old soldier out of the house, and
saw him start in the direction of the station. But her haste was in
vain. A telegram which arrived that evening from Princess Lida
informed her mother that she was married to Captain Roburoff, and that
the ceremony had been performed by an Orthodox priest in the chapel
attached to the Thracian Legation at Vindobona. This astonishing fact
made it clear that some personage high in authority had been acting in
collusion with the fugitives, and before long every one at Ludwigsbad
knew that the Princess of Dardania had solemnly declared she would
never forgive Count Mortimer for his part in the affair. Cyril smiled
when the news reached him.
</p>

<p>
“Excellent!” he said. “She has now a legitimate reason for hating me,
whereas before she could not very well avow the cause of her enmity.”
</p>

<p>
The person who had told him of the rumour, and to whom he spoke, was
the Chevalier Goldberg, just returned in triumph from Czarigrad with
the long-coveted concession in his hands. The possession of Palestine
was once more secured to the Hebrew race.
</p>

<p>
“But wid whom is she seekink to inchure you?” asked the financier in
reply. “Europe knows now de truth about her defeat in de affair
celebrated by Texelius, and will not beliefe her. Dere must be some
one outside de ranche off politics det she wishes to influence.”
</p>

<p>
“It is just possible,” said Cyril drily. The Chevalier took heart of
grace.
</p>

<p>
“My goot frient,” he said, “you will not take it amiss if I alloode to
your prifate affairs? You hef nefer honoured me wid your confidence
about dem, and I do not ask it off you; but chust et dis moment it iss
so closely connected wid de future off our great enterprice, det
unless you command me epsolutely to be silent, I must speak.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Chevalier, there was nothing to confide. My private affairs
are common property all over Europe, it seems to me. If you have any
contribution to make to the discussion, pray let me hear it.”
</p>

<p>
“I hef a request to make off you first. You must know det since it
became efident det de concession would be granted, we hef hed ill
noose from Pelestine. Rubenssohn, who iss chust gone out dere to
inspect de colonies, says de officials are prepared to ressent our
comink. A pasha here, a sheikh dere&mdash;dey all fear we shell confiscate
deir offices and cut short deir dishonest gains. De Greek and Letin
Churches encourache dem in dis epprehension, hopink to raise a
rebellion against us, so det Europe may step in and refuse us de Land.
Now, you are about to fissit Pelestine. Will you go about amonk dese
officials ess de emissary off de Syndicate, and quiet deir minds? Dey
could nefer stend out against you.”
</p>

<p>
“You are very kind. If I can do any good by reassuring the timid, I
shall be glad to be useful.”
</p>

<p>
“You will make what arranchements and promises you please; dey shell
be kerried out. Some off de officials might be continued in deir posts
et a fixed selary, oders be pensioned off. Den dere are de Beni
Ismail&mdash;dose Arabs in de desert between Damascus and Baghdad. Dey hef
been told by some enemy det we intend to gerrison Palmyra and exect a
heafy tribute from dem, and deir chieftainess, whom dey call de Queen
off de Desert, threatens to appeal to Europe. You will come to terms
wid de lady, and reassure her ess to our intentions? Dere nefer wass a
woman you could not talk ofer.”
</p>

<p>
“I will certainly do my best to conciliate her dusky Majesty. An
appeal to the Powers would land us in endless complications.”
</p>

<p>
“True; but dere iss more at stake still. While de diplomatists are
squabblink in Europe ofer de gofernorship off Pelestine, you are on de
spot, treffellink ess a prifate indifidual, yet makink peace and
pleasantness wherefer you go. It iss well for you to be out off Europe
et dis moment, my frient, but it is better for you to be in Pelestine.
You are already a <i>persona grata</i> et Czarigrad, et Vindobona, et de
Magnagrecian Court. Hercynia will follow Pannonia. You are de right
men for Pelestine, and dey must see it.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril shook his head. “It sounds excellent, Chevalier, but, after all,
I am not big enough for them. They might accept me as an emergency
man, just to do the dirty work and put the place in order; but it
would be strictly stipulated that as soon as things were pretty quiet
some princeling should step into my shoes.”
</p>

<p>
“No!” cried the Chevalier, with almost a shout. “Not if your prifate
intention in goink to Pelestine iss what I think. De saint you desire
to fenerate&mdash;pardon my boldness&mdash;iss it not de Queen Ernestine?”
</p>

<p>
“It is,” said Cyril, not quite calmly.
</p>

<p>
“Den all iss well. You merry de Queen; dere iss de position you need.
Through her you are connected wid half de royal femilies off Europe.
Dey must profide for her, find some post not disgraceful for you. Here
it iss.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril rose involuntarily from his seat, and began to walk up and down
the room, while his companion, trembling with excitement, watched him
narrowly. “You have taken me by surprise, Chevalier,” he said at last,
returning to his place. “It was my last thought, in seeking to recall
myself to the memory of the lady you mention, to better my own
fortunes.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes; I understend det. But what do you say now?”
</p>

<p>
“The matter is too complicated for me,” said Cyril idly. “I must refer
it to some one who can only see one side to a question. I will take
counsel with babes, and be guided by the advice they give me.
Mansfield,” he stepped into the anteroom, “I want your opinion on a
point of morals.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield glanced up quickly, suspecting a hidden irony in the
request; but Cyril’s eyes met his gravely enough.
</p>

<p>
“Suppose you had behaved badly to the woman you loved&mdash;broken her
heart in fact. Oh, for pity’s sake&mdash;&mdash;” as Mansfield attempted a
protest, “isolate your thoughts from my niece for the moment, and
imagine it possible that you could treat a woman cruelly. What would
you do when you repented and wished to undo the past?”
</p>

<p>
“Go to her and ask her to forgive me&mdash;if I could muster up sufficient
cheek.”
</p>

<p>
“Quite so. And if she refused to look at you?”
</p>

<p>
“I think,” with diffidence, “I should ask her again.”
</p>

<p>
“And worry her until she consented, I suppose? Well, that is not the
question I wanted you to consider. Suppose a reconciliation with the
lady meant the greatest possible improvement in your worldly
prospects, would you still feel free to seek her forgiveness?”
</p>

<p>
“I see.” It was evident that Mansfield was somewhat staggered by this
view of the case. He sat silent, turning it over in his mind, for some
minutes. “It would be perfectly beastly if people&mdash;or she
herself&mdash;thought one had done it for the money,” he muttered at last.
“Is it supposed that the lady still cares for you&mdash;I mean me&mdash;Count?”
he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“How can I tell? Well, yes; suppose she does.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, that makes it all right, of course; if it would be a comfort to
her. A man couldn’t fight shy of making what amends he could, just
because of what people might say, could he? If she seemed inclined to
forgive him, I suppose he would have to tell her about the money, and
see what she said. If she was willing to take him on again&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“He must be doubly grateful, and behave better in future,” interrupted
Cyril, finishing the sentence for him. “Thanks, Mansfield. See what a
good thing it is to know exactly what other people ought to do! Well,
Chevalier, the oracle has spoken, and the die is cast. I go to
Palestine.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier’s beaming countenance testified his delight, and he
proceeded to draw up, and submit for Cyril’s approval, a paragraph to
be sent to the newspapers, stating that Count Mortimer was about to
visit Palestine in the interests of the Jewish race, with a view to
the discovery of spots where new colonies might advantageously be
located. When the paragraph appeared the next day, the Princess of
Dardania was among those into whose hands it came. She smiled
contemptuously at the reason given for the journey, and called to
Countess Birnsdorf for writing materials. That evening Colonel
Czartoriski passed through Vindobona on his way to Syria, in charge of
an autograph letter from his mistress, which he was ordered to deliver
to no one but Queen Ernestine herself. The old soldier was frankly
exultant on the subject of his errand. The villain who had lured away
Princess Lida would at any rate not be allowed to find happiness with
another woman.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the person whose life was most deeply affected by
Princess Lida’s elopement bore himself with the utmost equanimity. It
was Prince Mirkovics who outstripped the courier despatched from
Ludwigsbad, and carried the news to King Michael in his mountain
shooting-box. When he had delivered himself of his self-imposed
message, the old nobleman paused suddenly, his weather-beaten face
shining with fresh hope. The King, who had listened to the
announcement with sullen acquiescence, glanced up and perceived his
expression.
</p>

<p>
“What is it, Prince? You look as if a bright idea had struck you.”
</p>

<p>
“That is the case, sir. Does it not occur to your Majesty that this
event removes the chief obstacle to your marriage with Lady Philippa
Mortimer?”
</p>

<p>
The King laughed harshly. “The chief obstacle?” he said. “You should
have heard what Count Mortimer said when I spoke to him on the
subject. I might have been a pickpocket. He told me I was not fit to
look at her.”
</p>

<p>
“Sir,” said Prince Mirkovics, “I am no courtier. I cannot, as your
Majesty knows, twist my rough tongue to speak smoothly, and I will not
attempt to say that Count Mortimer was wrong. Even when I was doing my
utmost to marry you to Carlino’s daughter a few weeks back, I was
ashamed of my own schemes. You were not fit then to address words of
love to her, sir; you are not fit now. But the remedy lies in your own
hands. Do you wish to be worthy of the lady?”
</p>

<p>
“You mean that I might promise to give up all this sort of thing?”
King Michael gave a comprehensive wave of the hand, which included at
once the pictures that adorned the walls of his room, the empty
bottles on the table, and the scattered cards strewing the floor. “If
she would marry me, I should be perfectly willing to make such a
promise&mdash;and I would keep it, too,” he added, with some anxiety, for
Prince Mirkovics still looked forbidding.
</p>

<p>
“No, sir, that would not be sufficient. I know Lady Philippa and her
parents well enough to feel sure that they would not be satisfied with
promises. Your Majesty must give up all these habits at once, and
submit to a period of probation, to show that you have really forsaken
them, before you attempt to obtain the lady’s hand.”
</p>

<p>
“What a disgusting idea!” The King looked blank. He had paved the way
carefully for his own suggestion, but it was quite another matter to
adopt the uncompromising scheme of reform set before him. “It would be
so wretchedly hard to have to do it all without even being sure of
her,” he added.
</p>

<p>
“Is the lady worth it, sir?” demanded Prince Mirkovics. “And would it
not give you a claim on her respect, her admiration, if you could go
to her and say, ‘Without seeking to bind you, I gave up all my
unworthy pleasures for your sake, merely in the hope of rendering
myself less unfit to address you. In order to have more to offer you,
I have tried to govern my people better, and to raise my kingdom again
to the position it occupied under your uncle’s administration’?”
</p>

<p>
“But suppose she won’t marry me after all?”
</p>

<p>
“I would not suppose such a thing, sir. The lady could scarcely fail
to see that it was her duty to marry your Majesty, in order to secure
the happiness of your people and the welfare of the kingdom, and I am
certain that she will do whatever she feels to be her duty.”
</p>

<p>
“All right, then!” King Michael dashed his fist upon the table. “By
the bye, you know, you must take office if all this has to be done. I
can’t carry it through alone. Roburoff’s conduct furnishes us with an
excellent pretext for coolness towards Scythia, and then the Ministry
will have to go. You shall be Premier, and cultivate Pannonia instead.
That will only be until we are married, of course. Lady Philippa will
certainly want her uncle to return to Thracia with her. Oh, I say,
that reminds me; what about that secretary fellow? Roburoff declares
he is in love with Philippa, and Count Mortimer makes a great pet of
him. What is there to prevent his running off with her while I am
carrying out my reformation?”
</p>

<p>
“I saw Count Mortimer only this morning, sir, before I left
Ludwigsbad, and he mentioned that he was about to make a pilgrimage to
Palestine, taking his suite with him. The secretary will be farther
from the lady than your Majesty.”
</p>

<p>
“So he will. Well, Prince, I will try your plan for three months&mdash;not
a day longer. That ought to be proof enough for any girl of a man’s
sincerity. Don’t you think you have reason to be grateful to Roburoff?
I should be if I hadn’t paid him in full. Oblige me by looking at
this.” He held out a folded paper, which Prince Mirkovics received
doubtfully, and read with astonishment. It was a promise on the part
of the King to pay Captain Roburoff a sum of money which to the frugal
mind of the Thracian appeared colossal.
</p>

<p>
“What is this, sir?” he asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
“Princesses are expensive wives for commoners,” returned King Michael
calmly, “and Roburoff had no intention of marrying Lida on a captain’s
pay. I was obliged to make it worth his while.”
</p>

<p>
“Impossible, sir! You arranged the elopement with your equerry?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, not at all. I discovered that he was in love with her through
his dropping a note of hers when we were fencing one day. After we had
teased him about it a little, it occurred to me that since he had gone
so far for his own pleasure, he might as well make himself useful. It
was very hard to convince him, for he was quite contented to let
things go on as they were, and I had to point out that the prospect
for the future was not exactly to my taste. At last we came to terms,
and I despatched him on a special mission, giving him credentials that
would carry him anywhere (of course never dreaming of the use he would
make of them), and this is the way he repays my confidence! Don’t you
think we are well rid of him?”
</p>

<p>
Too much disgusted to speak, Prince Mirkovics bowed in answer. The
King laughed. “Come, Prince, I must drink one last toast before I
become a total abstainer, and you will join me in it with all your
heart.” He touched the bell. “Bring a bottle of champagne,” he said to
the servant who answered his summons. “Fill the glasses, Prince. To
Queen Philippa!”
</p>

<p>
“To her Majesty Queen Philippa!” repeated Prince Mirkovics gravely,
touching the glass which the King held out with his own.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
King Michael was as good as his word. Twelve hours before Prince
Soudaroff, despatched in hot haste to bear him the condolences of the
Scythian Imperial family, and to discover how the loss of his bride
seemed to affect him, could reach the hunting-box, its tenant was
hastening homewards across Europe. The state of affairs in Thracia
demanded his presence there, so he gave out. Arrived at his own
capital, the King found that he had accidentally spoken the truth
respecting the political situation, and that the course of events was
all in his favour. The shock of the sudden rupture of the betrothal on
which he had built all his hopes proved too much for Drakovics, the
great Premier whom Cyril had driven from office, and who had in turn
ousted him. The unholy compact with the Princess of Dardania which
restored him to power had become void, and almost simultaneously with
the arrival of the news, a stroke of paralysis dragged from his
failing hands the reins which he had clutched with such persistent
determination. The rest of the Ministry, deprived of their head, and
painfully aware that they held their places merely at the pleasure of
Scythia, were in no condition to combat the vigorous measures of their
youthful monarch. Drakovics would have bowed to the storm and
maintained his position, but his colleagues, left to themselves,
resisted, and gave the King the excuse he wanted for dismissing them.
Returning humbly, after an interview with the Scythian agent, to
tender their submission, they found their places filled up. Prince
Mirkovics had accepted office, and the scattered forces of Cyril’s
supporters rallied round him with magical unanimity. They were of the
King’s opinion. Prince Mirkovics was merely holding the premiership in
trust for his leader, and very shortly the period of progress at home
and high prestige abroad, which had ended with King Michael’s
attainment of his majority, might be expected to return.
</p>

<p>
It was in vain that the Emperor of Scythia sought to conciliate the
young King by removing Captain Roburoff’s name from the roll of his
regiment, in vain that he despatched his brother, the Grand-Duke
Eugen, on a special mission of friendship, in vain even that the
Princess of Dardania sent her “beloved, deeply injured Michael” a
heartrending message entreating him to return to Ludwigsbad, if only
for a day, that she might know he had forgiven her. Prince Mirkovics
pointed out to his master with a grim smile that the beautiful
Grand-Duchess Sonya Eugenovna was now staying at the villa, and a
polite refusal was returned. The opportunity of regaining her credit
with Scythia by entangling King Michael a second time was not to be
granted to the Princess.
</p>

CHAPTER XI.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">EASTWARD HO!</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Foiled</span> in the hope of regaining her empire over King Michael, the
Princess of Dardania turned with desperate vigour to the object which
lay even nearer to her heart. It was not enough to count the days
until she might hope to hear from Colonel Czartoriski of the success
of his mission in acquainting Queen Ernestine with the villainy of the
man who professed to love her&mdash;the Princess counted the very hours. At
last the anxiously expected missive lay before her, but in the fulness
of her triumph she allowed herself to gloat over her vengeance for a
while before opening the envelope. When at length she drew out the
letter and read it, the change that passed over her face was terrible
to see. Colonel Czartoriski had not been successful. The Queen had
positively refused to receive him when he presented himself at the
Deaconesses’ Institution at Brutli. He tried bribery and cajolery in
vain; and Princess Anna Mirkovics, the Queen’s maid of honour, who had
acted as her Majesty’s mouthpiece throughout the negotiations, assured
him that it was hopeless to attempt to obtain an interview. She
offered to take charge of the letter of which he was the bearer; but
in view of his mistress’s stringent order that he was to place it
himself in the Queen’s hands, Colonel Czartoriski thought it well to
ask for further instructions. The Princess of Dardania glanced through
his formal phrases with a heart-sickening sense of bitter failure.
</p>

<p>
“He has been before me!” she said to herself, alluding not to Colonel
Czartoriski, but to Cyril. “He has warned Ernestine that I shall try
to prejudice her against him, and she is prepared to believe
everything he says and nothing that I say. This explains his
astonishing tardiness in first visiting Egypt and then Palestine,
instead of going straight to Beyrout and the Lebanon. He has made
things safe for himself already. Well, Czartoriski must wait at
Damascus and watch for a chance of giving Ernestine my letter, and it
may be possible to spoil their reunion in another way.”
</p>

<p>
That very day Colonel Czartoriski received a fiery telegram in cipher,
which he read without astonishment as the hasty utterance of an
outraged mother, dashed off in a moment of desperation. He would have
been amazed to learn that the Princess had spent hours of anxious
thought over the brief message.
</p>

<p>
“Do not return to tell me that the base wretch has achieved all he
desired. Is there not one among the Christians whom he has betrayed to
avenge the Holy Places on this renegade?”
</p>

<p>
Colonel Czartoriski’s chief impression on reading the telegram was
that it was of too compromising a nature to be retained safely in his
possession, and, after fixing the contents in his mind, he destroyed
the paper. This done, he was able to consider the message calmly. The
suggestion which it contained struck him as worthy of notice; for he
had relinquished his earlier intention of challenging Cyril to a duel
<i>outrance</i>, reflecting that in such a conflict he was unlikely to be
victorious. Although, in the frenzied state to which the contemplation
of his mistress’s wrongs had reduced him, he would not have shrunk
from death if he could have ensured the destruction of his foe, he
felt that justice would be but poorly satisfied if Cyril killed him
and escaped unscathed. Since, then, a duel was not to be thought of
save as a last resort, he allowed his mind to dwell with something
like complacency on the hint thrown out by the Princess. Palestine was
filled with fanatical pilgrims from Southern and Eastern Europe; how
probable it was that Count Mortimer might meet with a fatal accident
while in the neighbourhood of one of their stations! For a minute or
two it seemed to Colonel Czartoriski that such an accident was so
likely as to be almost inevitable, but as soon as his brain had
regained its balance he perceived that the matter was not one to be
left to chance. Unless the consequences of Cyril’s present diplomacy
were pointedly brought to the notice of the pilgrims, he might pass
unharmed from one end of Palestine to the other. It was clearly
necessary that the destined avengers should be made properly
acquainted with the state of affairs&mdash;and how should this be done
unless Colonel Czartoriski made it his business? At first the old
soldier shrank back appalled from the idea: it was too much like
hounding men on to commit murder. But the thought of the Princess’s
sorrows overcame his compunction once more, and he salved his
conscience with a few curt platitudes to the effect that, since the
law often failed to punish the greatest offenders, it was well to
ensure that justice should be done at last. Thus satisfied that it lay
with him to bring criminal and punishment together, he began to ask
himself how the duty might best be performed.
</p>

<p>
It is not seldom a delicate task to put in motion the slowly revolving
wheels of justice, and Colonel Czartoriski realised this as he sat
smoking on the verandah of his Damascus hotel and laboured at the
details of his plot. It was evident that he must not appear in
connection with it, since the mention of his name would lead the world
to infer the complicity of the Princess of Dardania; but he found it
difficult to devise any means of inciting a crowd of unlettered
fanatics to the requisite degree of hatred without communicating with
them directly. After various fruitless attempts to solve the problem,
he threw away his cigar and strolled out into the town, hoping that
some chance sight or sound might give him the enlightenment he sought.
He had scarcely left the shelter of the courtyard when the help he
needed presented itself. Bumping and jolting over the alternate
hillocks and hollows of the street came a carriage, in which sat a
tall man with flowing black hair and beard. His dark robes, and the
lofty head-dress which surmounted his stern features and piercing
eyes, marked him as a bishop of the Orthodox Church. Two monks sat
opposite him, so obviously in awe of his displeasure that even the
discomforts of the drive evoked not the slightest murmur from either
of them.
</p>

<p>
“The very man!” murmured Colonel Czartoriski. “How could I have
forgotten that Bishop Philaret had gone on pilgrimage?”
</p>

<p>
The reverend travellers had only snatched a very brief rest at the
Greek Convent, to which they were bound, when Colonel Czartoriski
entreated the honour of an interview with the Bishop of Tatarjé. His
request was granted at once, for the two men were old acquaintances.
Bishop Philaret had brought the whole strength of the reactionary
party in the Thracian Church to swell the forces of the Princess of
Dardania when she had arranged the betrothal between her daughter and
King Michael, which overthrew Cyril and restored M. Drakovics to
office. In return for this signal service, it was commonly understood
that when Archbishop Socrates, the Metropolitan of Thracia, should be
gathered to his fathers, his successor in the see of Bellaviste would
be the ambitious and able Bishop of Tatarjé. The recent events in
Thracia had, of course, blurred this fair prospect, and the Bishop and
Colonel Czartoriski met as fellow-sufferers by a common disaster.
</p>

<p>
“If either her Royal Highness or I myself had been in Thracia, this
would not have happened,” said the Bishop, as his attendant monks
brought coffee and sweet jelly for the refreshment of the visitor.
</p>

<p>
“It is a European misfortune,” observed Colonel Czartoriski gloomily.
</p>

<p>
“European? it is a misfortune to the whole Church&mdash;a thing to make one
shudder!” cried the Bishop. “For many years I have looked forward to
this pilgrimage, but I never ventured to leave Thracia until now.
Everything seems safe&mdash;the King at Ludwigsbad under her Highness’s own
eye&mdash;and I set out with a quiet mind. I spend two peaceful months in
visiting our brethren in Armenia and Mesopotamia, and as soon as I am
once more within reach of telegraphs and newspapers, what do I learn?
Why, that the old dotard Mirkovics is Premier, and the Mortimer close
upon his heels!”
</p>

<p>
In common with the other members of the reforming party in Thracia,
Prince Mirkovics held that his own brother, Bishop Andreas of
Karajevo, would be the most suitable successor to the present
Metropolitan. Bishop Philaret did not mention this fact, but Colonel
Czartoriski was acquainted with it.
</p>

<p>
“And it is perfectly certain that all might have been avoided if your
Greatness had not been absent from Thracia!” he said regretfully. “Do
you intend to return to your diocese immediately?”
</p>

<p>
“What is the use?” asked the Bishop snappishly. “The mischief is done,
and I can’t undo it any more than your mistress can. I shall stay here
until the great band of pilgrims from Scythia lands at Haifa, as I
intended, and go up to Bethlehem with them for Christmas. After all, I
may be more useful when I return to Thracia than if I had rushed to
measure my strength against the new Ministry at once, and had failed.”
</p>

<p>
“Quite so,” returned Colonel Czartoriski, with anxious cordiality. “I
am certain your Greatness will find it the best plan to remain
quiescent until you see a chance to strike effectually. And, moreover,
there are other reasons why I should congratulate you on having
undertaken your pilgrimage this year. After a very few months
Palestine will be closed to Christians.”
</p>

<p>
“Closed to Christians!” cried the Bishop incredulously.
</p>

<p>
“Has your Greatness not heard that the whole country has been sold to
the Jews?”
</p>

<p>
“I heard that Count Mortimer&mdash;like a discarded servant who takes to
brigandage&mdash;was trying to bring about something of the sort, but in
passing through Vindobona on my way to the East I fell in with Prince
Soudaroff, who assured me that everything was ready for the
destruction of the scheme, and the political annihilation of the
Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas! events have not stood still while your Greatness was beyond the
reach of telegraphs and newspapers. Count Mortimer is so far from
being annihilated that he feels it quite safe to leave Thracian
affairs in the hands of Prince Mirkovics, while he himself looks after
his larger interests here. He has bribed the Grand Seignior to sell
the country to him on behalf of the Jews, and next Easter he intends
to be crowned in Jerusalem the first king of the Jewish State!”
</p>

<p>
The manifest improbability of this forecast did not strike Bishop
Philaret. “And the Holy Places?” he ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
“I believe their inviolability is to be guaranteed by the Powers. But
a paper guarantee!&mdash;your Greatness knows what that is, something that
the Jews will tear up as soon as the Powers need money.”
</p>

<p>
“We will preach a holy war against Mortimer and his Jews!” cried the
Bishop. “The Orthodox of Scythia and the Balkans will rise in their
millions, and free the Holy Places for ever from the dogs.”
</p>

<p>
“But the conflict would be terrible, even if we were successful. Let
your Greatness reflect a moment. The Jews can hire
soldiers&mdash;Protestants, Moslems, Pagans even&mdash;and there will be plenty
of Hebrews who have been forced to serve in the Scythian armies to
lead them. And if Sigismund of Hercynia should be seized with an
impulse to take their part&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I see, I see,” interrupted the Bishop hastily. “But is there no hope
of sowing dissension among the Jews? If those of one country alone
could be brought to detach themselves from this infamous alliance, its
power would be broken. I would support&mdash;even propose&mdash;concessions,
substantial concessions, for the Jews in Thracia, if they would
consent to abandon Count Mortimer’s scheme.”
</p>

<p>
“It would be useless. By means of some extraordinary system of
terrorism, the originators of the plan have contrived to force all the
Jews in the world to enter into combination with them. I questioned
Speyerl, the Princess’s Vindobona banker, on the subject as I came out
here, but he would tell me nothing. I could see that his mouth watered
at the thought of the profit he might make if he broke loose from his
countrymen, but he assured me he durst not do it.”
</p>

<p>
“The thought of the next world has little terror for a Jew,” said the
Bishop, with a laugh. “Count Mortimer has probably made use of very
mundane threats.”
</p>

<p>
“As mundane as his own hopes,” agreed Colonel Czartoriski. “Has your
Greatness guessed who is to share with him the throne he intends to
establish in Jerusalem? No other than your late beloved and venerated
regent, her Majesty Queen Ernestine!”
</p>

<p>
Bishop Philaret sprang to his feet, and an exclamation broke from him
which in a layman would have been called an oath, but from his
ecclesiastical lips was doubtless a solemn curse. If there was one
person whom he hated more than Cyril, it was Queen Ernestine, who had
refused him the Metropolitical mitre thirteen years before, preferring
to dismiss M. Drakovics and risk a revolution rather than consent to
his appointment. For some minutes he strode up and down the room,
alternately muttering anathemas and gnawing his beard, then halted
abruptly before Colonel Czartoriski.
</p>

<p>
“See here,” he said rapidly, “I will force my way into this convent at
Brutli, and demand an interview with the Queen. She knows me of
old&mdash;that I do not hesitate to strike&mdash;and I will make her understand
that if she desires to see her lover again alive, he must give up both
the Jews and his schemes of self-aggrandisement.”
</p>

<p>
“It is useless,” said Colonel Czartoriski again. “Her Majesty will not
receive your Greatness. She refuses even to see me, although I am the
bearer of a letter from my august mistress. There can be no doubt that
Mortimer has warned her to receive only visitors accredited by
himself. You would see no one but Mlle. Mirkovics, who will tell her
mistress just as much or as little as she chooses.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, the Mirkovics girl would face the devil and all his angels in
the Queen’s behalf,” said the Bishop, not perceiving with what
unpleasant company he was associating Colonel Czartoriski and himself;
“but,” he spoke lightly, “if this is the case, my conscience is clear.
I was merely desirous of warning her Majesty to keep her lover out of
harm’s way. Curiously enough, it is a fact that the pilgrims with whom
I hope to travel southwards from Haifa are extremely
enthusiastic&mdash;even fanatical&mdash;in their attachment to our holy and
orthodox faith.”
</p>

<p>
“True,” said Colonel Czartoriski, “and Count Mortimer is travelling
northwards from the Egyptian frontier. It would be sad indeed if he
met with any accident.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing could be more lamentable,” agreed the Bishop. “In fact, I
feel it my duty to take precautions lest anything of the kind should
occur. The simple pilgrims may quite possibly have imbibed wrong ideas
of his doings, and I will therefore make a point of explaining his
true character to them. I need scarcely say that I shall warn them
expressly and in set terms against using any violence if they should
happen to find themselves in his neighbourhood.”
</p>

<p>
“The advice is only what might be expected from your Greatness,” said
Colonel Czartoriski gravely. “It would be too cruel if all the care
Count Mortimer has taken to divert suspicion from his
intentions&mdash;approaching his goal by such a lengthy route and such
gradual stages&mdash;were to be wasted.”
</p>

<p>
“And how sad it would be if Queen Ernestine were to see a dead body
carried into her convent, instead of welcoming a living lover!” cried
the Bishop, his teeth displayed in a smile that could only be called
wolfish.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The two plotters at Damascus and the Princess of Dardania would have
been equally surprised to learn that they had credited Cyril with a
greater degree of caution than he possessed. No letter had passed from
him to Queen Ernestine, and it was not with the idea of concealing his
true destination that he approached Palestine from the south. Two
motives, the existence of which was scarcely confessed even to
himself, he allowed to sway him. One was the determination to do his
duty to the utmost before gratifying his personal wishes, which sprang
rather from pride in his own self-mastery than from any ascetic notion
of self-denial, but the other was a dread lest his humiliation should
after all be in vain. Ernestine might spurn him as he had once spurned
her. Cyril did not care to contemplate this possibility, but the mere
thought made him willing to defer the time when it might become a
fact. Attended by his three inseparable followers, he pursued his
journey without hurry, and also without undue delay, halting here and
there to meet the heads of a Jewish community, and explain the
significance of the new state of affairs. Encouragement was little
needed at this juncture, except in the case of those Jews who had
hitherto regarded the Zionist movement with suspicion or dislike. All
the rest appeared to have taken a step forward&mdash;the step from bondage
to freedom, from despair to hope&mdash;and many were already preparing
their possessions for the journey to Palestine, awaiting only the
summons to start.
</p>

<p>
At Vindobona Mansfield made the acquaintance of Dr Koepfle, to whom
the Chevalier Goldberg was fond of alluding as the brain of Zionism.
It struck him as quaintly curious that the man who had been chiefly
instrumental in arousing an enthusiasm unprecedented in modern times
should himself be enthusiastic purely as a matter of business.
Business-like from head to foot was Dr Koepfle, intent on giving
practical form to the dreams of many generations, and crystallising
the vague maxims of scattered visionaries into a workable
constitution. He was not ashamed to confess that it was the intolerant
Anti-Semitism of his Christian fellow-subjects that had first
suggested to him the possibility of a refuge over-seas for his race.
Nay, his mind was so severely practical that he had been willing to
look to the New World for a colonising ground when the difficulties in
the way of obtaining land in Palestine seemed insuperable. In the same
business-like spirit he accepted Cyril’s co-operation, displaying
neither the <i>empressement</i> of the Chevalier nor the distrustfulness of
Dr Texelius. Cyril, on his side, declared to Mansfield that it was the
most refreshing thing on earth to come across a man who was content to
accept facts as they were. Capable of meeting men of the world on
equal terms, Dr Koepfle was able, on the occasion of conferring with
his compatriots, to pump up as much serviceable enthusiasm as assisted
him to lead them in the right way, without either chilling their zeal
or allowing himself to be carried away by it. With the harshness of
youth, Mansfield suggested that an enthusiasm which could be folded up
and put away so conveniently might merely be assumed on particular
occasions; but Cyril told him that he had failed to allow for the
contagious influence of the emotion dominating a crowd.
</p>

<p>
At Trieste they fell in with a Zionist of a very different type, for
here Rabbi Schaul had taken up his abode for a time, in order to
bestow his blessing on the members of his flock now to be found on
board every steamer leaving for Palestine. Sauntering down to the quay
to look for their own vessel, Cyril and Mansfield found themselves
accosted by a venerable white-bearded man in shabby robes of black,
who raised his hands heavenwards and called down blessings in sonorous
Hebrew on the head of the liberator of Israel, following up his words
by bowing low enough to kiss the hem of Cyril’s coat. Then turning to
the Jews who stood around, gazing in astonishment at the homage paid
by their renowned teacher to a Gentile, he explained to them in Jargon
that when the Temple was rebuilt, and Messiah reigned in Jerusalem,
this stranger would undoubtedly be admitted to the royal table as a
guest, not as a servant like other Gentiles, and allowed to feast on
the flesh of Leviathan, since it was owing to him that the desolations
of Zion were about to be repaired. Mansfield listened, deeply moved,
although he understood only a word here and there. He treasured up the
incident for Philippa, wishing she could have witnessed it for
herself, for he knew that its pathos would have touched her keenly. As
for Cyril, he freed himself good-humouredly from the old man, waving
aside the throng of disciples who were prepared to follow his example,
and called to Mansfield to come on board quickly.
</p>

<p>
“You know, Rabbi, that I don’t care to advertise myself,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“But how are we to refrain from showing our gratitude to your
Excellency?” asked Rabbi Schaul. “Here are all these sons of Israel
leaving the house of bondage for the promised land, and many are gone
already. Many more are going in the spring, and I myself among them.
How can I forget that, thanks to your Excellency, I shall in truth
keep the Passover next year in Jerusalem?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril nodded pleasantly, and took refuge on board his steamer, where
he expressed to Mansfield his satisfaction that Alexandria was their
destination, and not Beyrout or Haifa, for which ports these fervid
Zionists were bound.
</p>

<p>
In Egypt, indeed, there proved to be little that was fervid about the
patriotism of the Jewish community. Its members were as business-like
as Dr Koepfle, but with this difference&mdash;that they had their own
interests in view, and not those of Zion. They treated the acquisition
of Palestine purely as a matter of trade. Doubtless Count Mortimer had
arranged with the Chevalier Goldberg to receive a due reward for his
services, and, now that his work was over, he had nothing to do with
the future of the country. It was the property of the United Nation
Syndicate, and they would exploit it and make the most of its
commercial capabilities for the benefit of the shareholders. It was a
matter for grave discontent that the land was being colonised on such
a large scale by the poor city-Jews of Europe, since the aim ought to
have been to secure immigrants already accustomed to agricultural
life, and not necessarily belonging to the Chosen Race. At present
much time, and therefore money, was being wasted in teaching the new
settlers and correcting their mistakes. Mansfield listened in
sorrowful and wondering disgust while these prosperous people,
themselves secure in their enjoyment of liberty and property under
British rule, talked glibly of the Holy Land as an estate to be worked
for their own advantage, without reference to the needs of their
oppressed brethren. A scheme was even proposed, and largely discussed,
for making the Holy Places more valuable from a pecuniary point of
view, by means of judicious selection and rearrangement.
</p>

<p>
“It is so miserably mean and degraded!” Mansfield cried angrily to
Cyril, who had rallied him on his sour looks. “These people have the
romance of the ages behind them, and the fulfilment of the prophecies
just ahead, and they think of nothing but cent per cent!”
</p>

<p>
“You have been disillusioned, and you speak severely,” said Cyril,
with great sweetness. “I am thankful I never took the trouble to set
up ideals, when I see how other people suffer in seeing theirs
overthrown. But why don’t you blame the tyranny of centuries, which
has reduced the Jews to this lamentable condition? You know the old
excuse, that because the Jew has been allowed to deal with nothing but
money, he has come to think that nothing but money exists.”
</p>

<p>
“But the Jew has allowed himself to be degraded.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, come, I see disappointment has made you merciless. Perhaps you
may be induced to modify the rigour of your judgments before long. I
shall be interested to see what you think of Herschel Rubenssohn, the
Ghetto poet, when we meet him in Palestine. He was the pet of London
society a year ago, and now he is a <i>bonâ fide</i> colonist.”
</p>


<h3 id="ch12">
CHAPTER XII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE CHURCH MILITANT AND ORTHODOX.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">It</span> was at a newly-established colony of Scythian Jews in the
neighbourhood of Hebron that the travellers found Herschel Rubenssohn,
roughly clad and labouring with his own hands like one of the
<i>fellahin</i>. He had turned his back deliberately upon the days when
English hearts had thrilled in response to his rehearsal of the
tragedy of his race, and the Anti-Semites of the Continent had been
lashed to frenzy by his cutting sarcasm. The pen was laid aside, and
the poet was intent on the best methods of cultivating olives, and on
finding new species of vines unaffected by the diseases which attacked
those native to the country. Even these lowly tasks could not be
performed in peace, for he was called upon incessantly to quell the
disputes which arose among the pale-faced, gaberdined and ringleted
denizens of the Ghetto who were his fellow-colonists. It was his duty,
also, to act as interpreter for them with the Roumi authorities, and
to mediate in the many misunderstandings that broke out between them
and the peasants who worked for them. Cyril’s invitation to dinner he
accepted with unfeigned pleasure, confessing that when he left London
he had little expected ever to regard an opportunity of donning
evening dress as an occasion of rejoicing. The momentary return to the
old life, which he had so often contemned, after the manner of poets,
as false and hollow, was a keen delight to him, and Mansfield found it
hard to believe that the vague-eyed man of the world, who knew his
London so thoroughly, could be one and the same with the industrious
toiler of the morning. Presently, however, the curious effect produced
by the contrast of the sunburnt face with the whiteness of the
forehead where the hat had shaded it attracted his attention. Looking
more closely at the guest, he saw that his delicate hands were
roughened and blistered within, and he conceived a growing admiration
for the man who had voluntarily left a life of ease for one of toil,
purely in the hope of setting an example to his nation.
</p>

<p>
But this admiration was not fated to endure very long. As Rubenssohn
grew accustomed to the company in which he found himself, the
vagueness left his eyes. In Cyril he discovered one who appealed to a
different side of his nature, and a mocking spirit took possession of
him. Mansfield and the melancholy Paschics listened with bated breath
while the guest embarked upon a career of destruction, sparing neither
the beliefs common to mankind generally nor those of his own people.
He ridiculed with the utmost impartiality the ideas of love and
immortality, the tyranny of the Law, and the Messianic hopes of Rabbi
Schaul. The keen arrows of his wit played round each subject in turn,
disclosing with cruel certainty the weak spot or the flaw. He made no
attempt to deny the degradation of his people, and in Mansfield’s view
he proposed no remedy for it. He believed in the Jewish race, it
seemed, and he accorded a qualified toleration to Judaism on account
of its services in the preservation of the race, but his Judaism
possessed neither prophecies nor the hope of a Messiah, and existed
independently of any religious sanctions. Its ecclesiastical system
had been evolved naturally enough during the progress of the race, and
ascribed, as other nations ascribed their religions, to the guidance
of a higher power. Freedom, toleration, a more natural mode of life,
these things would in his view raise the Jews far above the level of
other nations, and then the old fetters which had held the race
together might safely be shaken off. Mansfield thought of the
prosperous Jews whom he had met at Alexandria, and who enjoyed all
these blessings already, and his heart rose in revolt against
Rubenssohn’s philosophy. If this was to be the end, if the Jews had
remained a separate people merely that in the end of the ages they
might be better fed, clothed, housed, than the nations, throwing aside
callously the prophecies which had cheered them and the faith that had
sustained them in their sorrows, if they were to be bereft at once of
hope and of religion, then the heaviest of their former woes would be
a lighter curse than their new prosperity.
</p>

<p>
“I had rather be in the wrong with Lady Phil and Princess Soudaroff
than in the right with Rubenssohn,” he decided, remembering how often
he had listened to the old lady as she expounded her views on the
Jewish question and her interpretation of prophecy, Philippa at her
side concurring enthusiastically in all that was said. This time,
however, he did not confide his feelings to Cyril.
</p>

<p>
Jerusalem was the next place of interest to be reached, and Mansfield
had mapped out for himself a very definite plan for occupying his
leisure hours here. He intended to visit all the missionary
establishments in and around the city in which Lady Caerleon was
interested, and to photograph them and their inmates. Any spare time
was to be devoted to views of Jerusalem itself, and by dint of these
labours Mansfield hoped to provide a peace-offering which would not be
unacceptable to Philippa’s mother, and might even tend to soften her
heart towards him. But his plans were interrupted, and his fair
project brought to a premature conclusion, owing to the greed of human
nature. No sooner was it known that Cyril had arrived in Jerusalem
than his lodgings were fairly besieged. Jews, Mohammedans and
Christians, Syrians, Levantines, Greeks, Albanians, European
adventurers of all nations, crowded to wait upon him. Since the famous
revelations of Dr Texelius, so promptly contradicted by the Pannonian
official papers, nothing had been said of Count Mortimer as a
candidate for the governorship of Palestine, but there appeared to be
a general feeling that the future of the country lay in the hands of
this unpretending traveller, and the time-servers would not lose their
opportunity. Some of them wanted concessions and some contracts, some
Government offices and some commissions in the Jewish army or police,
some wished merely to gain the general goodwill of the possible ruler,
and some were anxious to confer benefits on him, in the shape of
invitations to their houses, or gifts of horses, carpets, and works of
art, without, of course, the slightest ulterior design. Cyril
disappointed them grievously by refusing alike their favours and their
requests, assuring them that he was simply an agent of the Syndicate,
and Mansfield developed a prickly suspiciousness that made him
distrust any one who addressed him civilly. This was the result of an
adventure of his own. Pausing in a back street one day to photograph a
picturesque archway, he was accosted by a respectable citizen, who
invited him into his garden, where was to be seen a piece of ruined
wall on which no tourist’s eye had ever lighted. Mansfield accepted
the invitation, took two or three photographs, and submitted to be
regaled with coffee and sweetmeats, all before he discovered that his
host had recognised him, and was anxious to obtain the contract for
clothing the army of the Jewish State. Then he rose up and fled, with
his faith in humanity sorely shattered, and kept rigidly to the beaten
track until he was rejoiced by Cyril’s decision to leave the city for
a short time. Business was impossible while the envoy was so
persistently mobbed, and it was advisable to pay a flying visit to
Jericho, since a sheikh in the neighbourhood of that place had
threatened to make himself disagreeable with regard to the fords of
the Jordan.
</p>

<p>
It was clear that Cyril’s movements must be kept to some extent a
secret, if he was to conduct the negotiations with the Roumi
authorities, for which he had come, without being pursued into the
very audience-chamber by the greedy throng of privilege-hunters.
Accordingly, he put the matter into the hands of the Chevalier
Goldberg’s agent, who secured him quarters for the night at Jericho,
in the house of a wealthy Jew, and despatched beforehand all that was
necessary for comfort. In this way Mansfield and his employer were
able to leave Jerusalem as if for a morning ride, and meeting, when
out of sight of the city, the guide and escort provided for them, ride
on at once to Jericho. The sight of the huge Scythian hospice,
constructed of late years for the accommodation of pilgrims, suggested
to Mansfield that their visit might have excited less remark in the
place if they had sought a lodging there, but Cyril laughed at the
idea.
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t know you were so anxious to see the last of me,” he said.
“The monks would indeed think that their enemy was delivered into
their hand, and it would be sheer ingratitude not to prepare a special
cup of coffee for his benefit.”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh proved more easy to deal with than had been expected, and
Cyril and Mansfield spent the evening at his village, discussing in
the most friendly spirit the various matters in dispute. As the guests
rode back to their quarters, passing the great fountain called
Ain-es-Sultan, Mansfield directed Cyril’s attention to several lights
which dotted the side of a precipitous mountain about a mile away.
</p>

<p>
“What can those be?” he said. “I didn’t see any houses there by
daylight.”
</p>

<p>
“That must be Jebel Karantal, the Mount of Temptation,” said Cyril,
“and the lights come from the hermits’ caves. We might ride over there
in the morning, if you are anxious to see the holy men in their native
dirt.”
</p>

<p>
As Mansfield reflected that the picture of a real live hermit might
help to console Philippa for all the photographs he had not had time
to take at Jerusalem, he accepted the offer gratefully, and did not
fail to remind Cyril of it the next morning. They rode at an easy pace
across the plain, with its thickets of tamarisk and thorn, starting so
many partridges and other birds that the hunter’s instinct awoke in
Mansfield, and he lamented more than once that they were not spending
several days at Jericho, so as to get a little shooting. Arrived at
the foot of the path which led up the mountain, they found standing
there a horse with a European saddle, in the charge of a native
servant, who told their grooms that his master, a Frank gentleman, had
started about half an hour ago to make the ascent.
</p>

<p>
“We are a little late,” said Cyril. “Evidently this place is becoming
popular as a tourist resort. I see a whole horde of Scythian pilgrims
in the distance,” and he pointed to a dingy mass of people, bearing
banners and sacred pictures, and headed by two priests in shining
vestments, that was approaching from the direction of Jericho. “But
they are not likely to have brought cameras with them, and we must
only hope for your sake, Mansfield, that our fellow-countryman has
been equally forgetful.”
</p>

<p>
Leaving their horses with the grooms, they began to make the ascent of
the mountain, finding the only path that offered itself alarmingly
narrow and steep. It grew worse instead of better higher up, and when
they were between three and four hundred feet above the plain, Cyril
wiped his heated brow and sat down upon a large stone which lay
temptingly in the shadow of the rock, on a ledge into which the path
widened at this point.
</p>

<p>
“I draw the line here, Mansfield. I may be getting old, but my life is
valuable to me, and I don’t feel justified in endangering it by any
further breakneck feats. If you are conscious of a yearning to risk
your neck on that giddy ascent in front, by way of emulating a fly
walking up a wall, pray go on, and I will sit here and await
developments. It will be some consolation to your afflicted relatives
that I am at hand to give your scattered remains decent burial.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield had been carrying his camera under his arm, but now he slung
it over his shoulder by its strap, so as to leave his hands free,
laughing as he did so, and applied himself to the further climb with
heroic determination, steadfastly avoiding the temptation to look
downwards. If his glance strayed for a moment from the almost
perpendicular path to the sheer precipice below, he felt sure that
nothing could save him from making personal acquaintance with its
depths. Presently he came to another ledge, which formed the approach
to the mouth of a cave, but glancing into the semi-darkness within the
dwelling, he caught sight of a pith helmet. It was clear that the
tourist whose horse they had seen below was talking to the hermit, and
Mansfield seized joyfully the opportunity of outstripping him and
reaching the summit first. Another terrific climb brought him to the
foot of an unsafe-looking flight of wooden steps, at the top of which
an elderly monk, very fat and very dirty, stood smiling hospitably.
Mansfield unstrapped his camera and photographed him in the act, then
accepted his beaming invitation to mount the steps to his cave. Here
he took one or two more photographs, making gallant attempts the while
to talk to his host in classical Greek pronounced in the modern
fashion, and smiling broadly, by way of making his goodwill evident.
His conversation or his smiles, or both, seemed to win the heart of
the hermit, for he found himself invited, partly by signs, to sling
the camera over his shoulder again, preparatory to climbing another
dizzy ascent, at the summit of which was situated the rock-hewn chapel
of which his host was the guardian. This was exactly what Mansfield
was most anxious to see, and he accepted the invitation with alacrity,
but stepped first to the edge of the little rock platform, in order to
estimate its distance from the plain.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise the greater part of the way he had traversed was
clearly visible, and he could see Cyril peacefully smoking a cigar
where he had left him. Receiving a wave of the hand in answer to his
shout, he was about to follow his guide up the face of the rock, which
at this point justified Cyril’s comparison by appearing quite
perpendicular, when his attention was attracted by the sight of a
crowd of people gathered round the horses and their grooms at the foot
of the hill. They were the Scythian pilgrims whom Cyril had pointed
out to him, and they were buzzing round the horses like a swarm of
angry bees. For a moment he thought they must be intending to steal
them, then he told himself that the presence of the grooms would
prevent that: the pilgrims were merely examining the novel English
saddles. He began the ascent, but, before passing round a projecting
rock which would cut off his view, he looked down again at the plain.
The pilgrims had quitted the horses, and were rushing up the path in a
confused mass, priests and people mixed together, one man only being a
little in advance. Mansfield’s heart misgave him, and he pointed out
the crowd to the hermit; but it did not need the old man’s raised
hands and look of shocked surprise to tell him that the pilgrims
should have mounted the hill in slow procession, singing solemn
litanies, and not with this indecorous haste. Cyril’s allusion of the
day before to the monks of the Scythian hospice recurred to him, and,
explaining hastily to the hermit that he must go back at once, he
turned to retrace his steps. He tried to shout a warning from the
platform in front of the cave; but it was evident that Cyril regarded
his frenzied gestures merely as the result of an ebullition of animal
spirits, for he waved his hand with the same placidity as before.
Giving up the attempt to make himself understood, Mansfield addressed
his energies afresh to the task of descending, which proved to be even
more difficult and dangerous than that of ascending had been. He was
out of sight of Cyril now; but before he had covered half the distance
that separated them, a sound mounted to his ear which made him hurl
away his camera and dash headlong down the path, regardless of his own
safety. It was the crack of a revolver, the sound of which travelled
far in the clear air.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Cyril, smoking quietly on his fragment of rock, and
all unconscious of danger, was disturbed by the noise of angry voices.
Almost as they reached his ear, a haggard man, in the flat cap and
long, dull-grey coat of the Scythian peasant, rushed round the corner
of the path, and recoiled precipitately on catching sight of him.
</p>

<p>
“Odd!” said Cyril to himself. “Mad, perhaps,” and mechanically his
hand sought his revolver in its accustomed pocket. His fingers had
scarcely closed upon it when the throng of pilgrims burst upon him
with furious shouts, and he had barely time to set his back against
the rocky wall before he found himself confronted by a semicircle of
angry faces, clenched fists, and menacing clubs.
</p>

<p>
“Kill him! kill the renegade!” was the cry. “Kill the traitor, and
save the Holy Places from the Jewish dogs!”
</p>

<p>
“You had better go on your way quietly,” shouted Cyril in his best
Scythian. “I am armed,” and he drew out the revolver.
</p>

<p>
“There are stones enough!” cried a voice, and a man who had found a
point of vantage flung a jagged piece of rock which struck Cyril on
the temple. The sight of the flowing blood appeared to stimulate the
ferocity of the mob, and deprive its members of such hesitation as
they may have felt in throwing themselves upon a solitary man, for
they sprang forward with a howl. Cyril had only time to fire one shot
into the air, in the hope partly of attracting Mansfield’s notice and
partly of frightening his assailants, before his right arm was broken
by a blow from a club as he raised the revolver, which dropped from
his hand. Hustled, beaten, and knocked about, the blood streaming from
his face, he had one thing, and only one, in his favour, and this was
that the pilgrims were so closely pressed together on the narrow ledge
as to be unable to get him down and trample upon him. Presently he
became aware that one of them, who must have caught it as it fell, was
holding the revolver to his head. Before the trigger could be pulled,
however, the voice of a priest, who had mounted upon the fragment of
rock upon which the victim had been sitting, rang like a trumpet
across the din.
</p>

<p>
“No shots! no shots! Will you give the heathen Roumis cause to accuse
us of murder? Throw the apostate over the precipice, so that it may
not be known whose hand executed judgment upon him.”
</p>

<p>
The man who held the revolver tossed it away reluctantly, and joined
with the rest in attempting to hustle Cyril to the edge of the path.
Crippled as he was, he fought savagely, contesting every inch of
ground, determined not to give his assailants the opportunity of
seizing him and hurling him down headlong. “If I go over, I won’t go
alone,” was the thought in his mind; and he fixed on a huge fellow,
whose efforts to catch him up bodily he had successfully foiled, as
the companion whom he would clutch with his last strength and drag to
destruction in his company. The unequal struggle was approaching its
only possible end as Cyril was driven farther and farther from the
rock. The pilgrims nearest the brink were beginning to edge away to
the right and left in order to secure their own safety, thereby
lessening the pressure on that side and adding to the force arrayed
against the doomed man, when a bullet whizzed past Cyril’s ear and
buried itself in the shoulder of the giant on whom he had decided as
his comrade in the fatal plunge.
</p>

<p>
“Bravo, Mansfield!” Cyril gathered breath to shout; but before the
words were out of his mouth there was another shot, and the club fell
from an uplifted hand which was brandishing it over his head. Crack!
crack! crack! came the sharp whip-like reports, and man after man
pushed his way, cursing, out of the mass, each effectually disabled
for the time, but not one mortally wounded so far as Cyril could see.
</p>

<p>
“Mansfield never fired those shots!” was his mental comment, as the
number of his assailants continued to diminish, until only a few
remained on the ledge, making no attempt to molest him, but looking
about in bewilderment to see where the shots came from.
</p>

<p>
“Git!” said a stentorian voice which seemed to resound from overhead,
and the crestfallen pilgrims, grasping the meaning of the
monosyllable, embraced with thankfulness the permission accorded them
to retire. Once safely round the corner of the rock, they collected
their wounded and made their way down the hill. The speaker&mdash;a lean,
elderly man in white clothes and a pith helmet&mdash;kept them covered with
his revolver until they were out of sight, then let himself lightly
down to the path, and approached Cyril, who had sunk on the ground in
perilous proximity to the edge of the precipice.
</p>

<p>
“Well, sir?” he asked slowly.
</p>

<p>
“I am infinitely indebted to you,” said Cyril, looking up with
difficulty as his rescuer reached him.
</p>

<p>
“Not you, sir,” was the prompt reply. “When I saw those Scythian
cusses preparing a new Holy Place for themselves by conducting a
Christian martyrdom on this spot, it struck me that Scythia had quite
as many Holy Places in this territory as was healthy for her, so I
just started in with my six-shooter right away. You bet it went to my
heart not to lay out two or three of the fellows, and specially the
reverend gentleman that took the rock for a pulpit; but I know the
ways of the Roumi authorities, and I didn’t want my business
interrupted by a judicial inquiry any more than you would. But I guess
there’s a dozen or so that will carry about with ’em for some time a
pleasing little souvenir of me, any way.”
</p>

<p>
While the stranger spoke, he had been helping Cyril gently back to his
former seat on the stone, and now began to bind up the wound in his
head with a handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
“Surely I know your voice?” said Cyril faintly. “It seems quite
familiar, and yet I can’t recall where I have heard it.”
</p>

<p>
The rescuer ceased his work, and stepped back for a moment. “The same
as ever!” he exclaimed in admiration. “Sir, I have many a time heard
you called the first gentleman in Europe, but I never expected you
would remember me, when the last deal we did together was over twenty
years ago.”
</p>

<p>
“Mr Hicks of the ‘Crier’?” asked Cyril, with an uncertain smile.
</p>

<p>
“Sir, you are correct. Elkanah B. Hicks, of the ‘Empire City Crier,’
who would be sitting in the head office of that paper as news editor
at this moment if he was not a fool. But he has got the wandering
strain in his blood, and threw up his berth to come out here, with the
excuse that it needed the best man the paper had got to fathom you,
Count.”
</p>

<p>
“I am flattered. Then it was not Turkish you spoke just now?”
</p>

<p>
“No, sir. I dispersed that crowd by means of the beautiful language
which is the common heritage of your nation and mine. Do you find
yourself comfortably fixed now, Count?”
</p>

<p>
He stepped back again to look critically at his work, just as
Mansfield, with blazing eyes and panting breath, charged down upon the
ledge, revolver in hand.
</p>

<p>
“Thank God you’re safe, sir!” he cried, with something like a sob.
“Where are the villains?”
</p>

<p>
“Hold him, Hicks!” cried Cyril feebly, as his secretary dashed past
him in the direction taken by the fugitives. “He is suffering from the
usual British malady, and yearns to go and kill something. He isn’t
safe.”
</p>

<p>
“Young man,” said Mr Hicks, flinging his sinewy arms round the
intending avenger, and holding him fast, “the bugle has sounded the
‘cease fire,’ and I guess you had better obey. Here’s your boss with a
broken arm and pretty near bleeding to death, and no doctor in this
forsaken locality but the one at the Scythian hospice. I reckon we
won’t requisition his services, but I shall want your help if I am to
fix things myself, old campaigner though I am. Give me that
shooting-iron for the present. Those things have a nasty trick of
going off of themselves when a young fellow is seeing red.”
</p>

<p>
Sobered by Mr Hicks’s speech, and very much ashamed of his temporary
madness, Mansfield surrendered his revolver, and returned to Cyril’s
side, feeling an irresistible inclination to choke.
</p>

<p>
“My dear youth, don’t be an idiot,” said Cyril, and the lump in
Mansfield’s throat vanished instantly. He even laughed, in a husky and
shame-faced manner.
</p>

<p>
“That’s better,” said Mr Hicks. “Take this chunk of wood, my young
friend, and split it in two, if you have a knife about you.” He handed
him one of the broken clubs with which the pilgrims had been armed
instead of the regulation staves, and Mansfield succeeded in obtaining
two fairly suitable pieces of wood, rounded on one side and flat on
the other. The surgeon continued to improve the occasion even while
the operation of setting the broken arm was proceeding, talking
meditatively as he worked, perhaps with the benevolent intention of
diverting the patient’s thoughts from what was going on.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, young man, I like your face, and I guess I don’t object to your
grit; but you’ll have to learn how to take things. A week as a special
in war time would teach you a thing or two. What’s happened to that
kodak of yours, now? I saw you figuring around with it while I was
interviewing the old nigger who calls himself a saint up there. You
hurled it away, did you, just as if it was a rock? and all the
pictures with it that you had concluded to take home to your best
girl? Now what a wicked waste! Pull, pull harder; that’s right. Keep
cool, young man; the frozen deep is not a circumstance to the coolness
you want before you’ll make a good man at a pinch.”
</p>

<p>
With such cheerful counsels as these Mr Hicks lightened the gloom of
the painful process he had in hand, but Mansfield scarcely heard them,
in his anxiety for Cyril. At last the patient opened his eyes and
said, “Don’t be too hard on him, Hicks. He’s a good chap all round.”
The busy surgeon nodded.
</p>

<p>
“I guess I’d turn him out a better if I had him on the ‘Crier’ staff,”
he said; but when the work was over, and Mansfield had gone to fetch
the servants, that they might lend their aid in carrying Cyril down
the path, Mr Hicks smiled confidentially at his patient.
</p>

<p>
“That young man has a heart of gold, sir, and worships your very
shadow. It’s not his fault that he hasn’t enjoyed my experience,
though it might have been awkward for you if I hadn’t chanced to be
wandering around in these parts. I guess, if you’ll allow me, that
I’ll fix my camp next to yours while you stay at Jericho. The wily
Scythian will find that it’s another story when he has to do business
with Elkanah B. Hicks.”
</p>


<h3 id="ch13">
CHAPTER XIII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">A GROUND OF HOPE.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Cyril’s</span> troubles were by no means over when he had been carried
across the plain to Jericho, with infinite difficulty, upon a litter
made by tying branches together with handkerchiefs and turbans. His
Jewish host listened with a terrified countenance to the story of the
attack, and although he did not actually entreat his guests to quit
his roof, he expressed dismal apprehensions as to its safety if they
remained under its shelter. Finding that they did not take the hint,
he withdrew to lament the state of affairs with his family, if the
sounds of weeping and wailing that followed were to be accepted as
evidence. Mansfield was disposed to ridicule his conduct as the result
merely of constitutional cowardice, but Mr Hicks pointed out to him
the strong probability that the man’s fears were well founded. A
second band of pilgrims was expected that evening at the Scythian
hospice, and it was not in human nature that the morning’s assailants,
thus reinforced, should resist the temptation to wipe out their
defeat. That motive would be sufficient, even without the hope of
killing the man whom they regarded honestly and with full conviction
as Antichrist. Clearly there was no time to be lost, and after a visit
to the authorities, which resulted in their posting a ragged and
half-armed guard about the house, Mansfield started on a hurried ride
to Jerusalem to consult the Chevalier Goldberg’s agent. It was with no
small reluctance that he consented to leave Cyril, even though Mr
Hicks had sworn to fight in his defence until the house fell in ruins
around them. Still, not only the lives of the party but the future of
the Jewish cause hung upon this day’s doings, and since Cyril was
unable to decide upon the steps to be taken, the Chevalier was the
most suitable person to do so.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the night Mansfield returned, half-dead with fatigue,
but accompanied by an escort of soldiers, and provided with full
directions for the future. Cyril was to be carried in a mule-litter to
an estate belonging to the Chevalier at Urtas, some miles to the south
of Jerusalem, where he could remain in safety until he was well again.
The agent would send out furniture and provisions, and see that the
place was properly guarded, and neither the hostile pilgrims nor the
Jerusalem concession-hunters were to be allowed to know where their
victim had taken refuge. A rest of an hour or so was all that was
granted to Mansfield and the soldiers, for Cyril’s host was on thorns
to get him out of the house. Mr Hicks, who had tacitly invited himself
to remain in medical charge of the patient, ordered a start soon after
daybreak, and Mansfield and he heaved a sigh of relief as they left
the house, only less fervent than that of the Hebrew who had succeeded
in getting rid of them. The travellers took the road to Jerusalem, but
turned southwards before reaching the city, and continued in that
direction until they arrived at the boundary of the Chevalier’s
estate. Here the steward, at the head of a well-armed body of
gardeners and husbandmen, welcomed the visitors in his master’s name,
and the escort, their duty performed, accepted a hearty meal and
sundry presents, and returned to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Life at Urtas was at once business-like and unconventional. The estate
was practically a huge botanical garden, in which experiments were
made in acclimatising foreign plants and improving by scientific
cultivation the products of the country. The house was merely a large
native dwelling, of no great pretensions, but the agent had sent out
from Jerusalem a wealth of rich carpets, bright-hued draperies, and
luxurious cushions, together with the irreducible minimum of European
furniture, as represented by a shaky table and four assorted chairs.
His care had even gone so far as to provide a Greek cook and a box of
books, the latter principally French and Italian novels of an
unimproving tendency. During the first few days Cyril was unable to do
anything but recline upon the cushioned divans and enjoy the Oriental
luxury of his surroundings, but before long the effect of the shock he
had received passed away, together with certain feverish symptoms
which had alarmed Mr Hicks at Jericho. Considerably before he could
fairly be called convalescent he was as busy as ever, although his
broken arm forbade him to write for himself. Every day the agent
forwarded from Jerusalem a huge pile of letters and telegrams, dealing
with all the complicated issues raised by the political situation, and
Cyril dictated the answers from his divan while Mansfield and
Paschics, who had joined the party from Jerusalem, took it in turns to
write, and Mr Hicks lounged in the verandah, looking in at the workers
now and then with a benevolent caution not to overdo things. When the
letters were finished, Paschics, who was less likely to be recognised
than either his colleague or the American, would ride with them to
Jerusalem, often bringing back a second instalment of correspondence
with him in the evening.
</p>

<p>
Nothing relating to the affairs of Zion could be settled without
Cyril’s advice, for the political barometer showed one of the curious
lulls which the wise in such matters consider to herald an approaching
storm. The Powers, cajoled, bribed, or threatened one by one into
submitting to the Jewish acquisition of Palestine, were waiting, all
dissatisfied but each reluctant to be the first to move, to see what
the Jews would do. At the New Year the control of the Holy Places was
to be handed over to the consular body, as representing united
Christendom, and the Roumi officials would give place to a Jewish
provisional government, under the suzerainty of the Grand Seignior.
The formation of this Cabinet, as it might be called, was one of the
most delicate tasks before the leaders of the movement. In order to
uphold the theory of representative institutions, dear to the hearts
of Dr Koepfle and his school, it was necessary that the members should
be formally elected by the Children of Zion throughout the world,
voting according to their “tents” or lodges. Whether representative
institutions stood or fell, however, it was obviously indispensable
that the persons chosen should not be obnoxious to the Powers, and
should be willing to maintain friendly, even respectful, relations
with the United Nation Syndicate. Cyril’s Balkan experience had left
him little to learn in the matter of conducting an election from
above, and it was to him that harassed wire-pullers appealed in every
difficulty. Frantic telegrams poured in upon him when a “tent” refused
steadily to vote for the candidate recommended to it by headquarters,
or when all the “tents” of one country plumped for Dr Texelius, who
was not one of the official candidates, to the huge delight of the
Anti-Semitic press, or when, as happened in England, those Jews who
were opposed to political Zionism made a vigorous attempt to capture
all the “tents” of the country, with the view of electing a
reactionary Cabinet. The wire-pullers did not appeal in vain, and even
Mr Hicks was moved to admiration by Cyril’s strategy, giving it as his
opinion that Tammany could afford to learn a trick or two from
Thracia.
</p>

<p>
The result of the election was to fill the prospective Cabinet with
men holding moderate views and willing to be guided; and if they were
virtually the nominees of Cyril and the Syndicate, this fact was not
likely to make the task of government less easy, but rather the
reverse. Cyril could not but be aware, although he gave no sign of
having perceived the fact, that to the Jews who were now crowding into
Palestine he was the Moses of this second Exodus. They were coming,
not with a wild rush, but in orderly bands, each family or individual
selected by the “tent” to which it or he belonged, and allowed to
start only when the necessary land had been secured in Palestine. The
genius of Dr Koepfle directed this migration with almost mathematical
accuracy; but Cyril’s name bulked far more largely before the world
than his, and there could be little doubt that when the immigrants
were invited to designate by means of a <i>plébiscite</i> the man who
should rule them, they would vote unanimously for Count Mortimer.
</p>

<p>
But this consummation, however devoutly to be wished, was at present
merely in the clouds. The Constitution which was to be administered by
the provisional government had been drawn up by the foremost Jewish
jurists&mdash;which is almost equivalent to saying the principal
Continental lawyers&mdash;and had gone the round of the Powers for approval
and criticism. It guaranteed freedom of conscience, freedom of trade,
and every political blessing that the human heart could in theory
desire, to people of all creeds and all nationalities, and yet the
Powers were not satisfied, although no one could suggest any
improvement. The lowering state of the political sky carried Cyril’s
mind back to the days when Caerleon and he had held the fort in
Thracia, alone against Europe, and when the only thing that saved them
from annihilation was the mutual jealousy of the Powers. “Nothing will
succeed here but success,” he said to himself, as he had said then.
“While each of them is waiting to see what the rest will do, we may
pull the thing through.” And he chafed the more under the physical
weakness which kept him tied at Urtas, when he might have been putting
his fortune to the touch, and gaining not only the position which his
Jewish friends desired for him, but also the happiness which up to
this point he had contrived to miss in his life.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Mansfield was very happy during this sojourn at Urtas. His work was
hard and the hours long, but he found time for a good deal of out-door
recreation. The agent had provided horses for the party, of a very
different type from the serviceable beasts which they had procured for
their journeys, and Mansfield loved all horses; while in the estate
and the model farm he found a whole world of delight. The steward, a
shrewd and ponderous Dutch Jew, told him when he heard of his path in
life that he was a good farmer spoilt, but Mansfield was quite content
to regard farming as merely a holiday amusement. It would not bring
him nearer to Philippa, which was what he hoped his secretaryship
would do.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Mr Hicks would join him in his rides, and generally on these
occasions they went hunting, as the natives called it, dignifying with
this lofty name a little quail- and partridge-shooting, for Mansfield
drew the line at shooting a fox, much to the disappointment of his
attendants. It was on their return from one of these rides that the
American said casually&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Say, Mr Mansfield, not come to any notion yet what your boss has got
on his mind, have you?”
</p>

<p>
“On his mind?” repeated Mansfield, in astonishment. “Nothing more than
the work and the political situation, I suppose.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess that would be about enough for most men,” said Mr Hicks
grimly; “but there’s something else wrong with him, He’s just pining
to make tracks from this place right now.”
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t noticed it,” said Mansfield, intending the remark as a
snub.
</p>

<p>
“You bet your life you haven’t, Mr Mansfield. You weren’t meant to.”
</p>

<p>
“But what is it?” Mansfield turned to face his tormentor; “and how do
you know anything about it?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, sir, if you saw a man fretting like a spirited horse to find
himself held fast in one place, and working all he knew to keep
himself from thinking, and all the time taking no proper pleasure in
his work or anything, what would be your opinion of that man?”
</p>

<p>
“He might be in fear of his life,”&mdash;this was intended to be sarcastic;
“or he might”&mdash;reluctantly&mdash;“be in love.”
</p>

<p>
“Sir, you have hit the very central point of the bull’s-eye. That’s
what’s wrong with the boss.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t see that it concerns you if it is.”
</p>

<p>
“There’s no lady in Palestine that he might have been on his way to
interview?” continued Mr Hicks imperturbably.
</p>

<p>
“You mean that Queen&mdash;Queen Ernestine of Thracia?” asked Mansfield
blankly. Could it be possible that the moral problem Cyril had
propounded to him before leaving Ludwigsbad had been based upon
Cyril’s own experience?
</p>

<p>
“That’s my notion,” was the cheerful reply.
</p>

<p>
“But why wait so long, and go so far round?”
</p>

<p>
“Because he’s half ashamed of coming back to her anyhow, and half of
being so long about it,” said Mr Hicks concisely.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t see how you know that.”
</p>

<p>
“Sir, I was at Bellaviste when King Michael came of age. You bet I
made things hum in New York with my reports of the festivities, and
the other specials had to fly around to get even with me, but when it
came to Count Mortimer’s dismissal the ‘Crier’ fairly took the cake.
The hours I spent hanging around at that Palace, working up all the
ins and outs of the affair from the servants and minor officials! But
it paid, sir, it paid. I wrote up the incident for the paper in my
most elegant style&mdash;real high-toned dramatic situations, heart-rending
pathos, and all the rest. I tell you, Mr Mansfield, those sheets were
wet with the scalding tears of the most beautiful women in America.
The Four Hundred was divided; half the ladies took the Queen’s side,
and half the Count’s&mdash;and where will you find a stronger testimony to
the fairness with which I had done my work? There wasn’t a likeness of
either of ’em left in a single store from one end of the Union to the
other. And having gone into the case to that extent, you tell me I’m
not even in the ring!”
</p>

<p>
“By the bye,” said Mansfield, still impenitent, “what miles of
interviews you must be sending off to your paper every day now!”
</p>

<p>
“I am doing my duty to the ‘Crier,’ sir. I was sent out to keep an eye
on all the proceedings in this transfer of Palestine, in which my
country has as large an interest as yours, and I am informed that all
the Churches in the States are subscribing to the paper since my
descriptive articles on the crisis started to appear. There’s not a
half-starved home missionary or a New Rush school-ma’am out West but
cherishes the hope of seeing Palestine before sending in their checks
at last, and they all calculate to have a share in the country. We are
giving ’em what they want&mdash;not a move in this high political game but
they hear of it, and if intelligent interest was allowed any weight,
the territory would be ours. But since it’s not likely that your
played-out old Powers will conclude to appoint America the guardian of
Palestine, as they ought to do if they want the property developed to
any extent, why, I am booming your boss all I know. When the pinch
comes, the great American nation will hurl itself solid on the side of
Cyril de B. Mortimer, and it would not surprise me if he took his
stand under the fostering wings of the American eagle. He knows who
are his friends, and would as lief do a deal with ’em in a friendly
spirit as not. He gives me an item or two most every day for my paper,
and is ready all the time to favour me with his opinions,&mdash;not like
some of your fine old crusted diplomats, who wouldn’t open their
mouths to save their lives. Now there was Sir Dugald Haigh, a real
petrified old chunk of British oak, no less. I was in Ethiopia for the
paper at the time of his Mission, close upon fifteen years ago now,
and not a word to be got out of any of ’em. Kept me fooling around the
servants’ quarters, trying to find out what they were doing, and
wasting my valuable time. Well, there’s something mysterious about
these things, any way&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” asked Mansfield, for Mr Hicks had paused darkly.
</p>

<p>
“Well, sir, that Mission was next door to a failure.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps that was not altogether the fault of the Ethiopians, was it?”
</p>

<p>
“Mr Mansfield, I guess I’m a white man. You don’t find me taking sides
with niggers against my own colour. No, sir. The fat was just saved by
Mr Stratford, the second in command (he’s Sir Egerton now and your
Ambassador at Czarigrad), who snatched it out of the fire when we were
all making our wills, but Sir Dugald had no hand in it. And now,
instead of prancing around in a coronet and ermine robes in the House
of Lords, that old man is buried up in Scotland somewhere, cultivating
oatmeal and a little literature&mdash;that is to say, he makes himself a
general nuisance by writing to the ‘Times’ when there’s any question
on hand connected with foreign politics.”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” asked Mansfield again.
</p>

<p>
“Well, sir, the boss is not that sort. He knows where the pay-dirt
lies, as I said, and things will pan out as he means ’em to. If he
concludes that he didn’t treat the lady you mentioned handsomely, he
may go back to her, but if he does, it’ll be because it suits his
book.”
</p>

<p>
“Look here,” said Mansfield, “if you go on making these vile
insinuations against him any more, you and I shall quarrel.”
</p>

<p>
“You bet!” was the unsympathetic reply. “No, sir, when a man finds
himself able to hitch his conscience and his convenience to his waggon
together, all that the public can do is to admire his team. Why it
should turn ugly and make nasty remarks on the harness I don’t know,
and you won’t find me doing it.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks swung himself off his horse as he spoke, with the air of one
who dismissed the subject, for they had ridden up to the house, but
Mansfield had been too much disturbed by the new ideas suggested to
him to be able to banish the conversation from his mind. When work was
over that evening, instead of going out as usual for a second ride, he
hung about the room in which he had been writing at Cyril’s dictation,
alternately rearranging his papers and trying to place Cyril’s
cushions more comfortably.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Mansfield, what is it?” asked his employer at last.
</p>

<p>
“I thought&mdash;I didn’t know&mdash;it occurred to me that you might want a
message taken to&mdash;to some other part of the country, as you are tied
here,” stammered Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“You are very considerate. A message to whom?”
</p>

<p>
“To the&mdash;to some one you were particularly anxious to see.”
</p>

<p>
“Come, Mansfield, out with it! Who is this mysterious person? Has
Hicks been pulling your leg?”
</p>

<p>
“I knew he had made it all up!” burst joyfully from Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“All what? I am afraid not. Did he tell you that I was on my way to
ask for an interview with Queen Ernestine, when the pilgrims
interfered with my plans?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but I didn’t believe him.”
</p>

<p>
“Cultivate a more credulous spirit. What he told you was perfectly
true, and so was his further information that this delay is almost
intolerable to me.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll start to-night,” said Mansfield, reproaching himself deeply.
</p>

<p>
“You can do nothing, unfortunately. I must see the Queen myself, and
approach her <i>in forma pauperis</i>. You know that I treated her
shamefully?”
</p>

<p>
“No. You can’t make me believe that.”
</p>

<p>
“But it is true, you see. King Michael behaved to her badly enough,
but it was not that which drove her into exile in Syria. She would
have gone with me cheerfully to poverty and obscurity in England, but
I would not take her. She entreated me on her knees, but I refused to
listen.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril spoke in a hard, even voice, and when he ceased there was
silence in the room. Mansfield tried in vain to think of something to
say, and each moment made the silence harder to interrupt. “I would
never have believed it if any one else had told me,” he groaned at
last, breaking the spell with a mighty effort.
</p>

<p>
“I knew that. You and I have taken a fancy to one another, Mansfield,
and I was curious to see what you would say when you knew how I had
treated the woman&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Who loved you,” supplied Mansfield, in a tone which was at once harsh
and dull.
</p>

<p>
“And whom I loved.”
</p>

<p>
There was a further silence, then Mansfield came hesitatingly forward.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t help it,” he said. “I should never have thought I could speak
civilly to a man who had done such a thing as that, but&mdash;it’s you.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Mansfield!” The reaction from the strained feeling of the
moment before forced a smile from Cyril. Mansfield sitting in judgment
upon him, and allowing his just severity to be biassed by his
affection for the culprit, was very funny. “You hate the sin, but you
have a sneaking kindness left for the sinner, eh?”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield laughed uncomfortably, and Cyril shook his head.
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid I shall have to send you back to England, Mansfield. You
must be deteriorating horribly, if you can condone such a departure
from your creed, even in my case. I suppose I have corrupted you. What
would Lady Phil say?”
</p>

<p>
“I shall never tell her. It would make her too miserable&mdash;about you, I
mean. But, Count&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Go on. I will relieve your wounded feelings in any way I can.”
</p>

<p>
“You were intending to&mdash;to try and get the Queen to be reconciled?”
</p>

<p>
“Before there was any idea of its being to my advantage? Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“And you mean to do it still? You think she will forgive you?”
</p>

<p>
“The woman I used to know would forgive me. But suppose she is
changed? I have no right to expect anything else, and I have only
myself to thank. There is just one thing&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Yes?” said Mansfield eagerly.
</p>

<p>
“Some time ago I was shown a photograph of her, taken since she left
Europe. The woman who showed it to me would have been the last person
in the world to wish to give me any hope, but she did not see the
significance of what I noticed. On the Queen’s arm there was a
bracelet&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Which you had given her?”
</p>

<p>
“Not quite. Prince Mirkovics’s daughter, one of her <i>Hofdamen</i>, gave
it to her once at Christmas. It had one very large diamond in it, and
to the uninitiated that was all. But the diamond was so cut that by
looking at it at a certain angle you could see a portrait in the
setting behind it. The Queen was delighted.”
</p>

<p>
“And it was your portrait? and she was wearing it still?”
</p>

<p>
“She was wearing it still. That is my sole ground of hope. But why I
should be pouring out my sorrows to you in this way, like young
Werther or the celebrated Mr Rochester, I don’t know. It isn’t for a
warning, because I can’t by any stretch of imagination conceive you to
be in need of it, and it certainly isn’t because I was yearning for a
confidant. It must have been simply your astonishing cheek in leading
up to the subject. Well, now your idol is broken, and I hope you are
pleased.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t think what made me do it,” said Mansfield, awkwardly. “I know
I must seem disgustingly inquisitive to you, but I only wanted
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“To annihilate time and space for my benefit, I know. Well, don’t
distress yourself. I could have shut you up at any moment I chose. As
I said, I wished to see whether you would quite turn your back upon me
when you knew the whole truth.”
</p>

<p>
“I could never do that, whatever happened. Try me.”
</p>

<p>
“I believe you. And now, if you have probed into my past history
sufficiently, perhaps you would not mind going round to the steward’s
and seeing what he has to say about the mule-litter that Hicks
mentioned this morning?”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks himself entered the room as Mansfield stumbled out of it, and
cast a glance of quizzical reproof at Cyril as he sat down on the
divan.
</p>

<p>
“I’d lay my last red cent, Count, that you’ve been tormenting that
unhappy young man again. The way you work upon his finer feelings is
the cruellest thing I ever saw. You play upon him like an organ.”
</p>

<p>
“Then why does he lend himself to it?” asked Cyril. “It’s not in human
nature to neglect such an opportunity. The luckless youth is
provokingly sane otherwise. My brother values his opinion, my nephew
and niece look up to him devoutly; I believe he even fancies himself a
little as a man of the world. Why should he take it into his head to
conceive such an adoration for me that he becomes like a child in my
hands? I can make him blush and stammer like a girl, and for no reason
whatever.”
</p>

<p>
“He don’t get much show out of his adoration, sir, any way.”
</p>

<p>
“No, indeed; and yet he keeps it up. Why does a woman torment her
lovers, Hicks? To show her power, I suppose&mdash;not necessarily because
she delights in seeing them miserable. It gives me a kind of pleasure,
no doubt, to know that I can raise the unfortunate Mansfield from
despair to the seventh heaven by a word, and plunge him down into the
depths again by another, and therefore I do it.”
</p>

<p>
“Guess you are keeping your hand in, Count, against the time they fix
you up with a whole territory to practise your fascinations upon.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t dabble in prophecy, Hicks, unless you want to postpone that
desirable time until the Greek Kalends. So poor Mansfield is tortured
to make a pastime for me, is he? Well, it will be all made up to him.
I intend him to marry my niece, and she takes after her father, and
could not hurt any one’s feelings in cold blood to save her life.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so, Count? Well, Mr Mansfield will have earned his
happiness,” said Mr Hicks drily. “But I guess you know some folks have
figured it out that the young lady is to marry the King of Thracia?
Old Prince Mirkovics is flying round putting the kingdom in order, and
whispering the secret to most every one he meets. You are not in it,
then?”
</p>

<p>
“Scarcely. For one thing, I don’t think my niece would come into the
scheme, and I am not so foolish as to undertake to marry her to any
one against her will. And then, you see, I am retained, as I said, in
Mansfield’s behalf.”
</p>

CHAPTER XIV.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">NO PLACE OF REPENTANCE.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> sojourn at Urtas, which had proved so irksome to Cyril, was not
doomed to last much longer. As soon as the watchful Mr Hicks could be
induced, against his better judgment, to allow him to travel, he was
on the road again, riding whenever it was possible. When the country
was so rough as to render horse exercise unsafe for a rider able only
to use one hand, he was content to be conveyed ignominiously in the
mule-litter. In his train followed Mr Hicks, acting both as surgeon
and chronicler. Cyril was well pleased to keep the American supplied
with exclusive information on points of general interest, since he
found him prepared to exercise a wise discretion with regard to
matters of real importance. Mr Hicks asked no more favourable
treatment than this. He had been sent out to write up the Palestine
question for the ‘Crier,’ and how could he do so better than by
encamping continually, so to speak, close to the fountainhead of
information on the subject? His retinue, added to Cyril’s, made an
imposing cavalcade, and the local governors and petty sheikhs honoured
with a visit were duly impressed.
</p>

<p>
The minds of these functionaries were found to be much perturbed,
owing to the reports which had been spread as to the intentions of the
new government, and it was sometimes a long business to reassure them.
Curiously enough, the worst and most malevolent of the mischief-makers
were the Jews whose families had been settled in the larger towns for
two or more generations. Supported in idleness by means of the
Chalukah&mdash;a kind of voluntary tax which the Jews throughout the world
imposed on themselves for the benefit of their poor brethren in
Palestine&mdash;these men, quite naturally, were fully satisfied with the
present. The prospect of a future in which their pretensions would be
examined and their privileges curtailed was not enticing. Hard work in
stubborn soil, even on land which was their own, would be a poor
exchange for ease and idleness, and these degenerate Israelites did
their best to avert it by inciting the Moslems to resist the change of
rule. Calumny after calumny was brought forward by the local
authorities, and refuted by Cyril, who made his way to the hardest
hearts by dint of a judicious combination of <i>bonhomie</i> and
<i>bakhshish</i>. It is true that the natives, having seen the colour of
his money, and heard of the liberty and other blessings in store for
them, chose to ignore the existence of the Jewish State altogether.
However, since they accepted all Cyril’s suggestions, and agreed to
pay their taxes to the officials whom he should appoint, their belief
that England was about to take possession of the country, and had sent
him in advance as her representative, mattered little.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the singular success of his labours, Count Mortimer’s journey
through the country bore the aspect of a triumphal progress. When he
arrived at length at Damascus, there remained only the Beni Ismail and
their Desert Queen to be placated before he could announce that the
whole Moslem population of Palestine was well affected towards the new
rule. To gain the goodwill of the Christians was a hopeless task, he
knew; but at this moment they were all fully occupied in intriguing,
with the support of the consuls of the Powers who protected them
respectively, for the aggrandisement of their property or prestige at
the expense of rival sects. Even Bishop Philaret had forgotten the
iniquities of the Jews for a time, and was so hotly engaged in a
controversy with the Latins over a piece of ground some seven feet
square, in which a ruined cistern (which he imagined to be a tomb) had
been discovered, that he had no leisure to waste in attacking Cyril.
</p>

<p>
As the travellers approached Damascus, it seemed to Mansfield and Mr
Hicks that their pace was faster than it had been at first. Cyril had
become more impatient of delay, less tolerant of any proposal to
digress from the appointed route for the purpose of visiting some
object of interest. They could see that his spirits were variable, in
spite of the rigid self-control which he exercised, and his physician
discovered that for the first time in his life he slept badly night
after night. When they reached the city, however, and had taken up
their quarters in the house of an Oriental cousin of the Chevalier’s,
he was calm and cheerful again. On the first evening of their stay he
was the life of the party, which included a cheerful young Roumi
aide-de-camp of the Vali or Governor-General, who was the bearer of
his superior’s respects and compliments. When the story of their
journeys had been told, Mahmud Fadil Bey had a good deal to say about
the one task that remained to be completed.
</p>

<p>
“We are all anxious to see how you get on with the Beni Ismail,” he
said, in his excellent French. “They have been a thorn in our side for
many a day, and we shall not be sorry to turn them over to you.”
</p>

<p>
“What is their peculiar wickedness?” asked Cyril.
</p>

<p>
Mahmud Fadil shrugged his shoulders. “They are simply an Arab tribe
who inhabit a tract of desert of which almost nothing is known, and
who make themselves rather more disagreeable than the rest. Of course
they have never paid any tribute&mdash;though our treasury officials
devised a pleasing fiction that the arrears had been accumulating for
centuries. It was practically a case of our paying tribute to them.
When the usual presents were not forthcoming, it was not long before
we heard that the Beni Ismail had robbed a caravan or two. It was no
use sending soldiers after them, for they knew the desert and we did
not, so we lay low and said nothing.” He glanced smilingly at Mr
Hicks, as he made the quotation in English. “Two years ago there was a
famine, and I suppose caravans became scarce. At any rate, the Beni
Ismail were foolish enough to wander close to the city in search of
food, and the Vali saw his opportunity. He drew a cordon of troops
round their encampment, and arrested them for non-payment of their
taxes. We had very nearly the whole tribe in our hands, and it was
intended to deport them to some other part of the country, where they
would be absolutely at the mercy of the Government. But, somehow or
other, they managed to pay up, though I will do the Vali the justice
to say that he did not diminish the sum he had named by a single
piastre. This tardy virtue was all very well; but he had no intention
of leaving the tribe at liberty to begin their old game again, and the
preparations for removing them were going forward, when&mdash;of all
people&mdash;the Pannonian Ambassador at Czarigrad took up the affair. It
was said that the Empress of Pannonia was interesting herself in the
creatures, though why she should I don’t know, but we were obliged to
let them go, on the understanding that the taxes should be paid in
future, and the attacks on caravans cease. Wonderful to relate, they
have kept their promise, thanks, I suppose, to their Queen, whom no
one had ever heard of before they got into trouble. It seems that she
holds her Court at some spot in the desert that the Arabs call Sitt
Zeynab. She had been wise enough to keep out of our reach, and we
restored her subjects to her.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you mean that the lady’s existence had been absolutely
unsuspected?” asked Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“Absolutely. It was supposed that the tribe were ashamed to confess
they were ruled by a woman, or perhaps afraid that we should make a
bold dash and secure her as a hostage. I believe the idea of appealing
to the Empress was hers, though it is a mystery why she should hit
upon Pannonia as the friend in need.”
</p>

<p>
“But has no one from Damascus ever seen her?”
</p>

<p>
“No one. Moreover, I have questioned different members of the tribe,
when they came to bring their tribute, since that time, and I think
very few of them have seen her either. I have been assured by one man
that she is ineffably old and practises magic, and by the next that
she is a perfect <i>houri</i> in youth and beauty. The most credible thing
I have heard is that she is always wrapped in a white sheet, like the
Druse ladies, that she is attended only by women, and that no one has
ever seen her face. The tribe speak of her as the Great Princess, and
her word is law. She is a splendid horse-woman, and she lives in a
haunted palace, and both these things impress them very much.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so, sir?” said Mr Hicks. “And why do you expect this
interesting female to come to blows with his Excellency, if I may
ask?”
</p>

<p>
Mahmud Fadil laughed. “I am afraid we are to blame for that. When the
last tribute came in, the Vali told the messengers that they might
think themselves independent if they liked, but let them wait until
the Prince of the Jews came, and see what all the Emperors in Europe
could do for them then! They asked innumerable questions, and got all
the information of the same kind we could give them, and retired to
tell their Princess, saying that she would know what to do.”
</p>

<p>
“I think this will involve a visit to her Highness as soon as we have
had two or three days’ rest and a look at Lebanon,” said Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“I hardly think you will get as far as Sitt Zeynab,” laughed the
aide-de-camp. “No one has ever yet reached it from Damascus, though
many have tried, some out of curiosity, and some for other reasons.
The Beni Ismail alone among the Arabs know the way, and they will
never take any one there. Once or twice we have caught one of the
tribe off his guard, and forced him to take charge of an exploring
party, but the explorers have always returned unsuccessful and without
their guide, after wandering very uncomfortably in the desert for a
few days. It is difficult to see how the place can be reached. We have
offered a reward to the Beni Ayub, a rival tribe, if they will find
out the way to it, but whenever the Beni Ismail discover trespassers
in their country, they cut their trespassing severely short. The town
does not seem to have been visited by any traveller, and the other
Arabs cannot even say how long the Queen has reigned.”
</p>

<p>
“Decidedly we must face these perils and make a dash for Sitt Zeynab,”
repeated Cyril; “but I intend to spend to-morrow in exploring
Anti-Lebanon.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
When the next day arrived, however, Mr Hicks came into Mansfield’s
room early in the morning, and roused him unceremoniously from a sound
sleep.
</p>

<p>
“Hullo! am I late?” asked the victim vaguely. “I’ll be down in a
minute. Does the Count want to start already?”
</p>

<p>
“I want you to start right now,” said Mr Hicks, “if you’re game to do
the boss a kindness at the risk of his turning ugly.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course I’ll do anything that wants doing,” said Mansfield, yawning
furiously.
</p>

<p>
“Well, the boss’s strength has just about petered out. This hard
travelling, and holding pow-wows with those old sinners all the time,
has been too much for him, considering he was dead set on getting to
his journey’s end right away. I looked in on him an hour back, at a
word from Dietrich, and found that he hadn’t slept a wink all night,
and was in something very like a fever. I took the liberty of giving
him a sleeping-mixture that will keep him quiet till the evening, you
bet. But if he starts riding up Mount Lebanon to-morrow, and finds
maybe that Queen Ernestine won’t see him at the end, it will about
settle his business. Now, what I want you to do is&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“To go and see the Queen,” said Mansfield, sitting up in bed.
</p>

<p>
“If she will permit you; but I want you to go and prospect around at
Brutli, any way. If you are able to see her, start right in and work
on her feelings till she can’t see for crying. I incline to think she
will come down to him at once, but allowing for wounded feelings and
insulted dignity, we’ll conclude that she only sends a message to
invite him up there. But even if you can’t see her, you can find out
when she walks out and where, so that we may bring him face to face
with her suddenly. Don’t give the boss away, of course. To every one
but the Queen you’re a tourist wishing to inspect the Institution, and
my darkey, who knows the country, shall go with you for a guide.”
</p>

<p>
“All right. I’m your man.” The words followed Mr Hicks as he left the
room, and another hour saw Mansfield set forth on his embassy. The
Citadel, the Seraglio, and the bridge over the Barada left behind, the
route lay for a while along a broad, poplar-bordered road, on either
side of which were white houses set in green gardens. This pleasant
shade came to an end at the foot of the hills, and the rest of the
journey presented itself as a hot and weary climb up steep
mountain-paths, the monotony of which was only occasionally relieved
by a grove of myrtles, or a happy valley with its terraced sides
covered with vineyards and mulberry-trees. The interest which he took
in his mission armed Mansfield against fatigue, and he clattered at a
dangerous pace down slippery paths, and dismounted to lead his horse
up steep ascents, with a dogged persistence which did not commend
itself to Mr Hicks’s elderly servant, who was irreverently known as
Uncle Sam. Two or three brief halts, undertaken purely for the sake of
the horses, failed to mollify Uncle Sam, and when the travellers rode
into the village of Brutli, only to behold the Deaconesses’
Institution towering above them at the head of a further long ascent,
his feelings overcame him. Approaching Mansfield, he hinted darkly
that the consequences would probably be serious for both of them if
they did not pause and lunch, in view of the early hour at which they
had started. Mansfield acquiesced reluctantly, and they asked their
way to the inn, which proved to be a more imposing building than those
in the other villages they had passed. The reason for this superiority
was revealed when the landlord explained with much pride that two
gentlemen and several servants belonging to the household of the Queen
of Thracia had occupied his best rooms for more than two years past,
and that this gratifying fact had obliged him to increase his
accommodation for visitors. He pointed, as he spoke, to a pleasant
vine-shaded verandah on the opposite side of the courtyard, in which a
table was set out in European fashion. A tall thin man had just taken
his seat, and a second European, stout and elderly, was standing at
the edge of the verandah, peering across the yard into the darkness of
the archway in which Mansfield stood. The landlord, with a hurried
apology, hastened towards him, to return in a moment beaming with
smiles, and bearing a request from the Thracian gentlemen that the
English traveller would share their meal. Delighted to find his path
made so smooth, Mansfield crossed the courtyard, to be met by the
short man at the foot of the verandah-steps, and received with
flattering assurances of welcome.
</p>

<p>
“I am ashamed to intrude upon you in this way,” began the guest.
</p>

<p>
“Intrude, monsieur! The sight of you is a perfect feast for our eyes,”
was the reply, in very rapid French. “We rejoice to greet one of your
nation. Once we regarded all Englishmen as our friends, now there is
an exception”&mdash;the thin man at the table growled indistinctly&mdash;“but
there is no need to proscribe a whole people for the fault of one man.
Let me present to you General Banics, formerly governor to his Majesty
the King of Thracia, now master of the household to her Majesty Queen
Ernestine. General, pray do me a similar kindness.”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur,” growled the General, “permit me to present to you M. Peter
Stefanovics, grand chamberlain to her Majesty. The coffee is growing
cold, Stefanovics.”
</p>

<p>
“All in good time,” cried M. Stefanovics, ushering Mansfield into his
place, and bowing himself to the head of the table. “Who can think of
coffee when one sees a new face? We are quite free and easy at this
meal, M. Mansfield, and wait upon ourselves. Madame Stefanovics does
not appear so early in the day.” Mansfield struggled with a look of
astonishment, for the meal which the two Thracians considered as
breakfast he had regarded as a midday lunch. M. Stefanovics caught his
glance.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you wonder at our hours, monsieur! But picture to yourself our
life&mdash;what is one to do here? We rise, we eat, we proceed to the
Institution to pay our respects to her Majesty, and inquire her
orders. It is very rarely that she honours us with any. We take,
perhaps, a walk or a ride for health’s sake. We return here, the
General sets to work at the military history he is writing, and I&mdash;I
go to sleep! Madame Stefanovics spends the afternoon and evening in
attendance upon her Majesty. We dine, we end the day with a game of
cards or dominoes. What would you have? Sometimes her Majesty is good
enough to make an errand for one of us into Damascus, sometimes one
has a week’s leave of absence. Then what dissipation, monsieur! One is
accustomed to Bellaviste, to Vindobona&mdash;can you conceive that one
feels a visit to Damascus to be a riotous affair?”
</p>

<p>
“But why does the Queen condemn you to such a life?” asked Mansfield
indignantly. “What right has she to keep you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur!” cried General Banics, bristling up like a tiger. M.
Stefanovics laid a soothing hand upon his arm.
</p>

<p>
“Calm yourself, General. Our friend does not understand. You may not
be aware, monsieur, that General Banics refused the post offered him
in the King’s household in order to attend her Majesty here. The
unhappy events&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Stefanovics, you talk too fast,” growled the General.
</p>

<p>
“My good General, how am I to explain things if you will interrupt me?
Circumstances, monsieur, impelled the General, as a man of honour, to
quit his Majesty’s service and enter that of the Queen. I was already
in her Majesty’s household, and my wife and I followed her here as a
matter of course. She did not ask us to remain. In fact, she entreated
us with tears to return to Thracia and make our peace with her son,
while she retained only her ladies about her person. Would you expect
us to do that, monsieur? to forsake our august mistress when she was
abandoned by all her friends, treated with the most revolting cruelty
by those who ought to have&mdash;&mdash;” an inarticulate remonstrance from the
General. “In a word, monsieur, we are here, and here we stay.”
</p>

<p>
“You could do nothing else,” said Mansfield warmly. Then, remembering
the object of his journey, he added, with lamentable duplicity, “I was
anxious to see the Institution; but if her Majesty is there, I suppose
visitors are not admitted. Or perhaps there are stated hours?”
</p>

<p>
“It is always possible to see the Institution, monsieur. Her Majesty
would never consent to interfere with the work of the good sisters,
who are a blessing to the whole countryside. But her own apartments,
and a small enclosed garden upon which they look, are sacred to her.
She receives no one, and she has not quitted the Institution since
first she entered it.”
</p>

<p>
“Never left the one spot!” cried Mansfield, aghast. “Surely she
must&mdash;I mean, has she taken any vows?”
</p>

<p>
“The Lutherans are not like the Orthodox or the Latins, monsieur, and
their deaconesses are not bound by irrevocable vows. It is her
Majesty’s pleasure not to receive, and it is not for us to question
it. The emissaries of the King and the Princess of Dardania made
themselves so obnoxious on her first arrival that, outraged by their
presumption and persistence, she came to this resolution. And is there
any one who has a right to decide for her Majesty in the matter?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly not,” said Mansfield politely, for the tone of the question
was fierce.
</p>

<p>
“There is a certain person,” pursued M. Stefanovics, “attached to the
household of the Princess of Dardania&mdash;a Colonel Czartoriski, I
believe&mdash;who has been hanging about this neighbourhood for weeks,
riding up from Damascus day after day, in the hope of being received
by her Majesty and delivering into her hands a letter from his
mistress. Of course he has not been successful. Is it likely that her
Majesty would receive him, when we, her two faithful servants, have
never been permitted to see her face the whole time she has been
here?”
</p>

<p>
“You have never once seen her?” cried Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“Stefanovics, you talk too much,” said General Banics again.
</p>

<p>
“And why should we be granted such an honour?” asked M. Stefanovics,
trying to cover his confusion. “If her Majesty, deceived and forsaken
by the man she trusted&mdash;no, General, I mention no names&mdash;and by her
own son, chooses to confine herself to the society of her ladies, who
will venture to blame her? The decision lies entirely with her.”
</p>

<p>
“Her Majesty’s retirement is very sad, but no doubt it is natural,”
agreed Mansfield, whose heart had sunk lower and lower as he discerned
each fresh obstacle in the way of his mission. In his own mind he was
convinced that the Queen was mad, but in the hope that sheer audacity
might succeed where the courtly training of the two Thracians held
them back, he determined to make an effort to penetrate into her
presence, that he might at least know the worst. He answered with much
patience the questions which M. Stefanovics, who had relieved his mind
by his outburst of confidence, showered upon him, and took his leave
when the meal was over without disclosing on whose behalf he had come.
He observed that neither M. Stefanovics nor the General asked any
questions about the great Palestine scheme, and that they both ignored
the tentative references he made to it; and it seemed to him that to
proclaim himself Cyril’s emissary would be to destroy the small hope
of success he still possessed. Leaving Uncle Sam and the horses at the
inn, he climbed the path to the Institution on foot, and asked the
lame Syrian who acted as porter whether it was possible for him to see
the place. The man bade him enter.
</p>

<p>
“The lady there is the senior sister,” he said, indicating a stately
woman in the blue dress and white cap of the Königshof deaconesses,
who was passing along the piazza. “She will direct you.”
</p>

<p>
Stepping forward and bowing to the deaconess, Mansfield repeated his
question in German, and found himself cordially welcomed. The interest
which he displayed as Sister Chriemhild conducted him in due course
through the hospital, the schools, the asylum, and the chapel, was in
no way feigned, for he intended to write Lady Caerleon an account of
his visit, and perhaps Philippa would read it. Nevertheless, his
attention wandered slightly as the tour of inspection drew to a close,
for he had not succeeded in making any allusion to the Queen, and it
seemed impossible to introduce her name naturally and without undue
emphasis. At last he relinquished all attempt at concealment, and
turned suddenly to Sister Chriemhild, who was explaining the methods
of instruction, peculiar to Königshof, which were in use among the
deaconesses.
</p>

<p>
“Sister, is it possible for me to see Queen Ernestine?”
</p>

<p>
“Quite impossible,” replied the deaconess, not showing the slightest
surprise at the abrupt question.
</p>

<p>
“I come from&mdash;at least, I have a message for her.”
</p>

<p>
She looked him straight in the face. “There is only one name that
would justify me in asking one of her Majesty’s ladies to see you and
take charge of your message.”
</p>

<p>
“I come from Count Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
The glow of delight that irradiated Sister Chriemhild’s face
astonished Mansfield, for in view of her grey hair and faded blue eyes
he had not expected to find the deaconess’s heart still young and
sympathetic. She took him into a small parlour, and hurried away.
Presently a stout middle-aged lady in black burst into the room; no
other word will express the excitement which characterised her
entrance. Bitter disappointment overspread her face at the sight of
Mansfield, and she returned his bow with a frigid curtsey.
</p>

<p>
“Have I the honour of speaking to her Majesty’s lady-in-waiting?”
began Mansfield, perplexed by the change in her manner.
</p>

<p>
“I am Sophie von Staubach, her Majesty’s lectrice. I am on duty
to-day. You must have heard my name from Count Mortimer. Excuse my
hurry. I could not wait to hear what Sister Chriemhild said. I took it
into my head that the Count was here himself. He always looks so
young, you know,” returned the lady, all in a breath. Her resentment
seemed to have evaporated.
</p>

<p>
“I am here on Count Mortimer’s behalf,” said Mansfield. “He is at
Damascus, making arrangements with the Roumi authorities for the
benefit of the Jews, and&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
Fräulein von Staubach uttered a little scream. “Sit down,” she said,
pointing to a chair, “and let us talk comfortably. Then Count Mortimer
is the Prince of the Jews, after all? Now tell me&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
She poured forth her questions. Where was Cyril staying, what was the
exact nature of his present occupation, how long had Mansfield known
him, what had he been doing since he left Thracia, did he look any
older, did he often mention the Queen, what was his object in seeking
her out?&mdash;and so on, without a pause. Mansfield answered her inquiries
as fully as she would let him, describing Cyril’s condition with all
the pathos he could command, and felt that success was in his grasp
when Fräulein von Staubach, who had been making occasional dabs at
her eyes with her handkerchief, suddenly broke down and wept noisily.
</p>

<p>
“Of course he treated the dear Queen abominably, but I have always
longed that he should come back and make it up with her,” she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
“Then will you tell me how I can see her Majesty, Fräulein?”
Mansfield felt it advisable not to protest against the lady’s opinion
of Cyril’s behaviour, but his self-suppression failed of its effect.
Fräulein von Staubach started violently, sat up and wiped her eyes,
and looked at him severely.
</p>

<p>
“It is quite evident that you are not accustomed to courts, sir,” she
said. “Her Majesty has not commanded you to wait upon her, I believe?”
</p>

<p>
“How could she, when she didn’t know of my existence?” asked
Mansfield, with not unreasonable impatience. “But if you will be kind
enough to tell her why I am here, no doubt she will allow me to wait
upon her.”
</p>

<p>
“It is impossible&mdash;quite impossible,” said the lady, nervously.
</p>

<p>
“Because her Majesty only receives ladies? But I am merely a
messenger&mdash;Count Mortimer’s messenger.”
</p>

<p>
“I know; but it is out of the question&mdash;I dare not&mdash;I mean, I cannot,”
stammered Fräulein von Staubach, with more distress than the occasion
seemed to warrant.
</p>

<p>
“Well, then, at least you will help to bring them together. Count
Mortimer will ride up here to-morrow, and you will manage to admit him
into the Queen’s private garden?”
</p>

<p>
“You won’t understand!” she cried. “Her Majesty’s decision is
irrevocable. Nothing I could do would induce her to alter it. If Count
Mortimer were here at this moment, and if he presented himself day
after day, entreating her Majesty to receive him, it would have no
effect.”
</p>

<p>
“But surely, Fräulein, her Majesty must be very much changed if this
is the case? And yet, from all you have been saying, I should almost
have thought she would be glad to see Count Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
Fräulein von Staubach flushed angrily. “I cannot answer for her
Majesty,” she said, with dignity, “and you have no right to put an
interpretation of your own on my unguarded remarks, sir. The utmost I
can do for Count Mortimer is to watch for an opportunity of bringing
his name to the Queen’s recollection; and I shall certainly not have
the chance for a fortnight, perhaps a month. It is useless for the
Count to come here at present.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield gazed at her aghast. This could only mean that the Queen was
mad, but enjoyed occasional lucid intervals. “Fräulein,” he said
reluctantly, “I entreat you to pardon me, but I must ask you a very
important question. Is it unhappily the case that her Majesty is&mdash;that
her troubles have&mdash;that her mind is affected?”
</p>

<p>
Fräulein von Staubach rose and glared at him before she could find
words to reply. “Oh, that is what your master wants to know, is it?”
she cried. “Go back and tell him that if she is mad he has made her
so. He wishes to free himself from her and marry the Princess of
Dardania, does he? Oh, yes; Princess Anna Mirkovics heard of his
recent proceedings from Colonel Czartoriski when she was on duty here.
Mad, indeed! her Majesty mad! Out of the way, sir; let me pass. You
have insulted my august mistress.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, Fräulein,” said Mansfield, amazed by this sudden burst of
passion. It was so timely that it might almost seem to have occurred
in order to afford the lady an excuse for terminating the interview,
but he was between her and the door. “If you refuse to answer me, I
must sorrowfully conclude that my conjecture was well founded. Is that
the message I am to take back to Count Mortimer?”
</p>

<p>
“Do you call yourself sane?” demanded Fräulein von Staubach
viciously; “because her Majesty is far saner than you are. You thought
she was mad, did you? No; you may tell Count Mortimer that if his
object was to drive her mad, he failed. Let me pass, sir!”
</p>

<p>
She swept out of the room in a whirlwind of righteous indignation. As
for Mansfield, he took a sorrowful leave of Sister Chriemhild, walked
down regretfully to the spot at which he had told Uncle Sam to meet
him with the horses, and rode back to Damascus with a gloomy
countenance. He had felt so sure of success, so confident of bringing
back with him some message, though perhaps only a word or two, from
the Queen to Cyril, and he had accomplished nothing. It was possible,
even, that he had done harm, and he began to wonder what Cyril would
think of the way in which Mr Hicks and he had meddled in his affairs.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">Really</span>,” said Cyril, “words fail me to express my gratitude. The
conspicuous success which has crowned your kind efforts would alone be
sufficient&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Say, Count,” broke in Mr Hicks, “don’t make us squirm ourselves right
away through the floor. Mr Mansfield is not to blame, any way, for I
despatched him and told him to go ahead, and I acted as I thought best
for you in my professional capacity, sir.”
</p>

<p>
“Professional capacity be hanged!” said Cyril, sharply. “What does
your professional capacity make of the result of this precious
expedition? Nice little encouragement for the patient, eh? Hearten him
up a bit, I suppose? You and Mansfield are both too clever for me,
Hicks. To the ordinary mind it would have occurred that in the
peculiar circumstances of the case my only hope was to go there myself
and take the Queen by surprise, but you have knocked all chance of
that on the head.”
</p>

<p>
“But, Count,” ventured Mansfield, “the lady said it would be quite
useless for you to go, because you would not be admitted.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you ever know me baffled yet in a thing I meant to do, Mansfield?
Fräulein von Staubach and I are old friends.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, she has promised to mention your name to the Queen at
the earliest opportunity. I will ride up to Brutli again to-morrow,
and try and arrange with her to let you know the moment she has done
it. But she said it would certainly not be for a fortnight.”
</p>

<p>
“A fortnight?” Cyril’s irritation subsided suddenly, as a new idea
appeared to strike him. “Mansfield, I want to know exactly what she
told you.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield cudgelled his brains, and, aided by a stringent
cross-examination, succeeded in recalling very faithfully the
conversation which had taken place between Fräulein von Staubach and
himself. When he had come to the end, Cyril smiled gently.
</p>

<p>
“Since you two have gone to work so ingeniously to spoil my plans with
regard to the Queen,” he said, “I shall put business before pleasure
once more, and devote this fortnight to looking up the Great Princess
of the Beni Ismail.”
</p>

<p>
“Great Jehoshaphat!” cried Mr Hicks, in consternation. “You talk of
setting off on a desert journey right now, Count, when you’re down
sick? A little ride in the cars to Beyrout, now, would bring you round
a bit, I guess, but a wild goose chase into the mouth of hell after a
female that no one has ever seen&mdash;no, sir! You may bet your bottom
dollar&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“That I go? Quite so. You needn’t come, you know, Hicks. If Mansfield
is willing to relinquish the right of private judgment, I’ll take him,
to punish him for the mischief he has done, but there must be no more
interference with my plans for any reason whatever.”
</p>

<p>
“You bet!” said Mr Hicks, energetically. “But you’ll have to conclude
to take me as part of the outfit, Count. Your physician extraordinary
won’t quit until he’s kicked out. And since you’re set on this piece
of foolishness, I suppose I may as well hand you a document which was
left for you to-day, but when Mr Mansfield came back and we began upon
this palaver, I forgot it.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril took the letter, which was written on rough native paper, and
read it through carefully. “How did you get hold of this, Hicks?” he
asked at last.
</p>

<p>
“Brought by a blind Arab with a book under his arm, Count. ‘From the
Great Princess,’ he said, as he handed it to me. He mentioned that he
was a Protestant, and seemed to incline to loaf around and ask
affectionately after the Churches of America, but I was in a hurry,
and fired him out.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Hicks! Why not have humoured the poor wretch, and kept him in
talk? He would have been able to give me just the information I want.”
</p>

<p>
“That is so, Count, and that’s why I invited him to vanish.”
</p>

<p>
“Won’t do, Hicks. You’ll have to find him again now.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess so,” said Mr Hicks resignedly. “Well, I reckon I’ll appeal to
our rackety friend Mahmud Fadil. He makes out to be acquainted with
all the shady characters in the city. But I hope the lady is kindly
disposed towards you, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Not exactly. She warns me not to meddle with her subjects or their
territory, on pain of an appeal to the Powers. Strange that she should
have picked up that idea, isn’t it? But her scribe writes French, so
very likely he is an Armenian from Czarigrad, full of the latest
European notions. Her seal is Arabic, you see, but it has only ‘I, the
Queen of the Desert,’ on it, no name.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
In fulfilment of the task imposed upon him by Cyril, Mr Hicks set out
the next morning to seek the help of Mahmud Fadil, who had no
difficulty in identifying from his description the person of whom he
was in search.
</p>

<p>
“I know him,” he said. “It is Yeshua, a dog of a Bedawi who professes
to have become a Christian, and is in the pay of the English ladies
who have the schools.”
</p>

<p>
“Could you manage to lay your hand on him?” asked Mr Hicks.
</p>

<p>
“You want him seized&mdash;put out of the way? Oh yes, it can be done, of
course, but it will be rather expensive, on account of the English
ladies. These wretched missionaries fly to their consuls on the
slightest pretext.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess I don’t just want him wiped out,” said Mr Hicks meditatively.
“A little quiet talk with him is all I ask. And if your soldiers could
be brought to understand, sir, that a small extra present would pass
between us if they carried the business through without fuss and
without hurting the gentleman’s feelings, it might obviate any
difficulty with the consul.”
</p>

<p>
Mahmud Fadil acquiesced in the proposal with some disappointment. He
had anticipated the handling of a considerable sum of money, a certain
proportion of which would naturally stick to his own fingers in the
process, but he gave the necessary orders, keenly conscious that half
a loaf is better than no bread. Accordingly, Cyril’s quarters were
invaded, shortly after darkness had fallen, by several file of
soldiers, dragging with them the blind man, who offered no resistance
beyond protesting against the illegality of his arrest. Mr Hicks was
on the look-out, and after reassuring the owners of the house, and
dismissing the soldiers with the reward agreed upon, led the prisoner
into Cyril’s room.
</p>

<p>
“Fear not, O father of a book,” he said in Arabic; “no harm shall
befall thee. Tell the Prince of the Jews who thou art.”
</p>

<p>
“My lord’s servant is Yeshua the son of Ishak,” answered the blind
man, turning his sightless eyes in the direction of the divan on which
Cyril was lying, “and he goes hither and thither among the tents of
his brethren to tell them the words of Life.”
</p>

<p>
“Was it you who brought me the letter from the Princess of the Beni
Ismail?” asked Cyril. Mr Hicks translated the question.
</p>

<p>
“My lord’s servant was sojourning a week ago in the tents of the Beni
Ismail, and their sheikh asked him to carry a message to the Prince of
the Jews. The tribe fear to enter the town, lest the Roumis should
seize and imprison them.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you did not see the Princess&mdash;I mean, she did not give you the
letter?”
</p>

<p>
“Nay, my lord, how should such a one as Yeshua ibn Ishak be admitted
to the presence of the Great Princess? One of her women had given the
paper to the sheikh.”
</p>

<p>
“I see. Did you find your way here from Sitt Zeynab alone?”
</p>

<p>
“Certain of the tribe brought my lord’s servant on his way for a part
of the distance. After that he knew the road.”
</p>

<p>
“Good. Will you guide me to the spot where they left you?”
</p>

<p>
“God forbid! Would my lord have his servant betray his brethren?”
</p>

<p>
“But I don’t want to do your brethren any harm,” said Cyril
impatiently. “I am not a Roumi. I am only anxious to make a treaty
with them.”
</p>

<p>
“Nay, my lord, thy servant cannot reveal their secret. They have
trusted him, and if he failed them they would blaspheme the religion
of the Lord Jesus.”
</p>

<p>
“I can hand you over to the Roumis, and have you thrown into prison,
if you refuse to answer me. Do you know this?”
</p>

<p>
“My lord must do as he will with his servant,” said the blind man.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Count, he’s too plucky to be threatened,” said Mansfield
indignantly. “Why not see if he will take a message back to his
sheikh?”
</p>

<p>
“I have no intention of eating him,” returned Cyril. “Well, Yeshua ibn
Ishak, will you find out your sheikh and tell him that I wish for a
friendly meeting with the Princess? These two <i>khawajas</i> shall come
with me, and we will bring one servant each, but no soldiers. I desire
peace with the Beni Ismail, not war, and if he will bring me to Sitt
Zeynab it will be for the good of all his tribe for ever.”
</p>

<p>
“But the Great Princess will never consent to talk with my lord.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps not; but she could send her scribe, or she might even talk
with me through a curtain. Will you take the message?”
</p>

<p>
“My lord’s servant will carry the word, but there is no likelihood
that the sheikh will consent. The stranger must not come into the land
of the Beni Ismail.”
</p>

<p>
“Time will show. Good evening, then. Mansfield, see that the man has
something to eat, and give him a few piastres if you think it will
make him feel more kindly towards us. How long do you say it will take
to get an answer to the message, Hicks?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, I guess the sheikh has some of his men cached not so
very far from the city, in case our blind friend has any news to
despatch. Would you incline to have him shadowed?”
</p>

<p>
“No; he would find it out, and the discovery would destroy his rather
shaky confidence in us. Suppose you jot down a few of the things we
shall need for the journey. I expect to start the day after
to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, sir, there’s nothing like assurance, any way,” said Mr Hicks,
sitting down at Mansfield’s table and appropriating his writing
materials. “Do you calculate to take tents with you?”
</p>

<p>
“He’s a good fellow, Count,” said Mansfield, returning. “He would not
take any money, because he said the Mission provided for his needs. I
looked at his Bible in raised type, and he told me how astonished the
Arabs were to see a blind man read. He seems to have some thrilling
experiences to describe, if only I could understand his English; but
it is rather sketchy.”
</p>

<p>
“You had better write an account of your interesting friend to Lady
Caerleon. I know that Syria is one of her many favourite
mission-fields. But while you are striking up an acquaintance with
this picturesque character, here is Mr Hicks doing your work. Tents,
did you say, Hicks? One small tent for the three of us. This
expedition is not going to be a picnic.”
</p>

<p>
“You bet!” murmured Mr Hicks disconsolately, as he resigned his place
to Mansfield, who wondered even more than he did at the calm
confidence with which Cyril continued to make arrangements for a
journey which neither of his companions believed would ever be
undertaken. But his foresight was truer than theirs. When Mansfield
returned the next day from visiting the bazaars, the citadel and the
walls, the ruins of the Great Mosque, and other lions of Damascus,
under the guidance of a Jewish youth, he found the blind Bedawi
sitting outside the house and waiting for him. After puzzling out the
meaning of Yeshua’s broken English, he entered Cyril’s room somewhat
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
“The blind man has come back, Count. He says that the sheikh consents
to escort you to Sitt Zeynab, but you must bring no servants with you,
only Mr Hicks and myself.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well; but in that case the sheikh must only have two of his own
men with him. It’s not so much as a precaution, for of course the
whole tribe might be hiding behind the first sandhill, but just to
show him that he can’t ride roughshod over me.”
</p>

<p>
“But Yeshua begged me to warn you not to go, Count. He says the Beni
Ismail have never allowed a stranger to reach Sitt Zeynab yet, and he
is afraid they mean to hold you as a hostage.”
</p>

<p>
“He doesn’t seem to realise that it is what I mean, and not what they
mean, that will come to pass. Let Yeshua arrange with the sheikh where
he is to meet us, Mansfield, and if it is out in the desert, tell him
to be waiting for us himself by the cemetery wall as soon as the gates
are opened to-morrow morning, that he may guide us to the right spot.
We will bring nothing but what we can carry on our own horses. The
tent must be given up.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess you’re real set on this mad business, Count,” said Mr Hicks,
as Mansfield left the room.
</p>

<p>
“That’s just what I have been trying to impress upon you for two whole
days, Hicks.”
</p>

<p>
But in spite of this solemn assurance, and the hasty preparations
which occupied the rest of the day, neither Mr Hicks nor Mansfield
really believed in the expedition until they found themselves riding
through the eastern gate of Damascus in the dawn of the following
morning. To all appearance they were bound only on a short excursion.
The sheikh had agreed to furnish water and desert fare for the
travellers, and each man carried a bag of corn for his horse, together
with an iron peg and a rope for tethering purposes. A pair of
capacious saddlebags, containing the smallest possible allowance of
additional raiment and toilet necessaries, and a large <i>abba</i> or cloak
of coarse cotton, rolled up tightly in front of the saddle, completed
the equipment of each. To Mahmud Fadil alone among those in authority
had the secret of their journey been confided, and his silence was
secured in the only effectual way, by means of a present and a
promise. The melancholy Paschics had been furnished with instructions
in view of all the possible complications of political affairs that
suggested themselves to Cyril’s mind, and placed in charge of two
telegrams, one for the Chevalier Goldberg and one for Lord Caerleon,
which were not to be despatched until the adventurers had fairly
started. Mr Hicks had been permitted to send a communication to his
paper, in which he dealt with the expedition in terms of such enticing
obscurity and tantalising reticence as to suggest that the whole
solution of the Palestine question hung on his being lost to sight in
the Syrian desert for a fortnight or more. Mansfield’s personal
preparations were not extensive, for he did little beyond writing a
letter to Lord Caerleon, which was only to be posted in case he did
not return from the journey.
</p>

<p>
Outside the gate was the camping-ground of the caravans from Baghdad,
with its hundreds of knee-haltered camels, and its bronzed Arabs
bargaining and quarrelling in a hopeless <i>patois</i> over the goods piled
up round their rough tents. Then came the dismal ride through the
native burying-ground, filled with the ruinous and half-open vaults of
the Christians on the one hand and the fallen tombstones of the Jews
on the other, and when this had been passed, the form of Yeshua could
be distinguished, waiting faithfully under the walnut-trees
overhanging the wall of the Protestant cemetery. After the usual
salutations had been exchanged, Cyril rode ahead with the blind man,
and Mr Hicks and Mansfield found themselves side by side.
</p>

<p>
“What is it you’re afraid of?” asked Mansfield all at once, observing
that his companion looked back apprehensively from time to time.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I must say I’m glad to have got the boss out of the city
without a fight, Mr Mansfield. There is an elderly military character
who’s been real pressing in his inquiries after him each day since we
came, and I guess his intentions are not healthy. I interviewed him on
behalf of the boss, but when I found that my friend did the general
utility business for the Princess of Dardania, and had something big
on hand, you bet his messages reached me and stopped there. The
language he made use of yesterday when I told him the Count was sick
yet was remarkably free, and he didn’t see fit to cool down until I
just had him into the yard and showed him a little fancy shooting.
Guess he won’t try the fire-eating tip again with me, after seeing me
print my initials on the wall in bullets, but I don’t mind telling you
I’ve been real scared lest he should be fooling round somewhere on the
street this morning and meet the boss.”
</p>

<p>
“But you don’t think the Count would fight him?”
</p>

<p>
“You bet your life he would, and paint the town red with his vital
fluid, too, if he was in his proper form. But he’s sick and strung-up
both, and I don’t care for the risk.”
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it wonderful how well he sits his horse?” asked Mansfield,
looking at Cyril as he rode in front.
</p>

<p>
“That’s what I tell you, he’s strung-up for this job. He has something
big in his eye that I don’t see. I must figure it out.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks relapsed into silence, pondering busily the problem he had
set himself, and Mansfield did not disturb his meditations as they
rode through the fruit-gardens and walnut-groves surrounding the city,
and then across the bare fields, populous just now with camels
belonging to friendly Arabs. The tribesmen were encamped in the
neighbourhood of the town for the double purpose of obtaining their
annual store of corn from the farmers, and allowing their camels the
luxury of grazing upon the stubble, which the peasants did not resent,
since it helped to clear the fields for the ploughing which would take
place when the winter rains were over. A little farther, and the signs
of cultivation became more rare, one or two villages were passed, each
with its belt of fertile soil, and then the desert itself came into
view&mdash;not a wide flat expanse of sand, but a region of stony hills and
rugged valleys, with here and there a patch of coarse grass or
starved-looking bushes. The blind man, feeling the way with the staff
he carried, seemed never at a loss to discover the track, which was
hardly distinguishable even to the eye, and at length, on rounding the
shoulder of a hillock in no way more remarkable than the rest, he
turned to Cyril and remarked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“This is the place where the sheikh will meet my lord.”
</p>

<p>
“Then he is late,” said Cyril, looking round.
</p>

<p>
“Nay, my lord, the Beni Ismail will not show themselves until they are
satisfied that the <i>khawajas</i> are their friends.” He raised his voice
in a shrill cry, and presently a head appeared, peeping suspiciously
round a rock at some distance. Informed of this, Yeshua repeated his
call, and presently three Arabs made their appearance from different
directions, each man leading his horse. The blind man went forward to
meet them, and an animated colloquy ensued, out of earshot of the
travellers.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t quite like the look of this,” said Cyril. “Is our blind
friend stipulating for his share of the spoils?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, Count,” said Mansfield; “he’s trying to get them to swear not
to hurt us. He told me he would. The poor beggar has cottoned to me
rather,” he added shamefacedly. “Yesterday I went to see the mission
with which he is connected, and the ladies told him, and he was
awfully pleased.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, don’t be ashamed of your good deeds,” said Cyril. “We shall
both be grateful for them when they have saved all our lives.”
</p>

<p>
Presently, with a beaming face, the blind man brought the sheikh
forward, and having introduced him to Cyril, took his leave,
whispering to Mansfield as he passed.
</p>

<p>
“They will not hurt you, <i>Khawaja</i>. They have sworn it on the Holy
Book.”
</p>

<p>
He turned back in the direction of Damascus, and before disappearing
among the sandhills, paused to hold up his book as a reminder to the
Arabs. The sheikh, who had been scanning Cyril’s face with an interest
which he tried in vain to dissemble, asked him through Mr Hicks
whether he would prefer to rest for a while or to proceed at once, and
on his choosing to push on, made a sign to his men, who mounted their
horses, one of them riding ahead as a scout.
</p>

<p>
In this way the three adventurers began a strange journey, the novelty
of which did not prevent it from palling upon them very quickly.
Sometimes the desert was hilly and rugged, sometimes it was flat and
sandy, but it was always arid, sunny, and treeless. The society of the
sheikh and his followers was as monotonous as their native scenery.
They made it evident that they preferred to keep entirely to
themselves, riding together in advance, and never, if they could help
it, exchanging a word with their unwelcome guests. When a halt for
food or rest became necessary, they showed the same anxiety not to
associate with them, seating themselves on the opposite side of the
fire, if there was one, and when there was none, taking shelter behind
their horses. At first Cyril made many determined efforts to induce
them to talk, with the help of Mr Hicks as interpreter, but in vain.
None of them would give him any information as to the extent of the
territory claimed by the tribe, their ruler or her capital, the
probable length of the journey, or the direction in which they were
going. His failure did not seem to dishearten him, however, although
he ceased his attempts to draw them into conversation, and he
sustained the hardships of the march in a way that was little short of
astonishing. The distance from one well to another, which must be
covered in a single stage, was often so great that the travellers fell
asleep from sheer fatigue as they rode, and on reaching the
halting-place could do nothing but tether their horses and throw
themselves on the ground for a few minutes of precious slumber, even
before thinking of the much-needed evening meal. The food, which
consisted almost exclusively of dry flaps of native bread and a sticky
preparation of pounded dates, was just sufficient to support life; the
water, on the other hand, seemed generally calculated to destroy it.
The small supply of tea which they had contrived to bring with them
was soon exhausted, and Cyril and Mr Hicks qualified the nauseous
draught with brandy; but Mansfield, who was a teetotaller, as became
Lady Philippa’s lover, drank it heroically unmixed. Shelter at night
there was none. The force of habit made the three foreigners creep as
far as possible under the bushes, when there were any, to the derision
of their guides, and they were also sufficiently fastidious to remove
all the most obtrusive pebbles from the spot selected for a bed; but
the large light cloaks that protected them from the dust by day served
also as a covering at night, and each man’s pillow was such as his own
ingenuity could devise from his small stock of possessions.
</p>

<p>
“It isn’t the grub I mind,” lamented Mansfield one day to Mr Hicks,
when the journey had lasted nearly a week, “nor even having to do
without a bed, but I do detest getting so horribly grimy. I don’t
believe I shall ever be clean again.”
</p>

<p>
“We’re all in the same boat,” responded Mr Hicks. “I guess some of the
haughty aristocrats that have entertained the boss in their marble
halls would think twice before speaking to him now.”
</p>

<p>
“He doesn’t seem to mind,” said Mansfield dolefully. “He said this
morning that the ease with which one learned to do without the
refinements of civilisation was a clear proof of the innate savagery
of human nature. Before I came I thought I would bring plenty of soap,
whatever else I had to leave behind, but there’s no chance of using
it. And as for shaving&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Well, think how you’ll wallow in the luxuries of an effete
civilisation when you get back to it!” was the sympathetic reply; but
Mansfield was wondering what Philippa would think of him if he
returned to England with a beard, and did not answer. “Guess we’ll all
be as fit as the Arabs if this goes on much longer,” continued Mr
Hicks cheerfully. “You and I are as hard as nails already. The boss
can’t get much thinner, any way, but just look at him! He’s spunkier
every day.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know,” said Mansfield, in a sudden burst of confidence, “it
almost makes me feel queer to see him riding on day after day with
that iron face, and not caring a hang for anything. He has been so
ill, you know, and that affair at Jericho&mdash;&mdash; Sometimes I wonder what
will happen to him if this business smashes up. He might&mdash;might&mdash;go
mad.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so? That notion has struck you too!” Mr Hicks glanced round
at Mansfield as the latter lowered his voice. “But don’t you go
expecting a bust-up. The boss is not taking any. He’s the man to go
fooling round in this desert until the Day of Judgment&mdash;sort of a dry
land edition of the Flying Dutchman, so to speak&mdash;rather than turn
tail and confess that he’s beaten. I’ve figured out that little
mystery by this time. The boss has planked his whole pie on the table
for this game, and he stands to win everything or go under. <i>Sabe</i>?
Say you run across a soldier of fortune. You receive him as a man and
a brother, until you get to know that he has not been above hiring his
sword out to a crowd of pirates. Then you dry up. That’s how it is
with the boss. If he comes to smash now he’s done on account of having
sided with the Jews against his own colour. His world can never
forgive that. But if he succeeds&mdash;why, then it’s as certain as things
can be in this uncertain universe that he’ll become a real brand-new,
properly organised, guaranteed by Europe, constitutional prince, with
a part to play that will take all his time and be a thing of joy to
him for ever. Do you guess he’ll let himself be fooled out of that by
any dusky scarecrow of a nigger chieftainess that chooses to work the
political racket and talk big about the Powers? No, sir!”
</p>

<p>
The march continued, with no diminution of its unpleasantness, and the
travellers began to wonder when it would come to an end. Ordinarily,
so they had understood from Yeshua, it was accomplished in a week; but
to all appearance they were no nearer Sitt Zeynab now than they had
been at the beginning of their journey.
</p>

<p>
“Guess I wish the desert wasn’t so like itself,” grumbled Mr Hicks to
Mansfield on the eighth day after leaving Damascus. “The hog that Mark
Twain came upon seven times over on the Riffelberg wasn’t a
circumstance to it. I could lave sworn we had passed those sandhills
before.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve been thinking so all day,” said Mansfield; “but I had an idea
that the heat and the monotony might be affecting my brain. Let’s ask
the Count what he thinks. I see he is suggesting a halt to the
sheikh.”
</p>

<p>
They followed Cyril, who had been riding ahead of them as usual, but
had now dismounted, and was walking his horse towards a clump of
bushes. Here he stopped, and appeared to brush away the sand and pick
up something. As they came up, he turned to them, and held out a small
metal match-box for their inspection.
</p>

<p>
“I buried it at the foot of that bush on the third morning after we
started,” he said. “I suspected some trick of this sort.”
</p>

<span class="chap_sub">THE HOUSE OF THE LADY ZENOBIA.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> three men looked at each other and at the match-box. Mansfield
broke the silence first.
</p>

<p>
“Then all this beastly journey has been for nothing?” he cried, with
youthful outspokenness. “We are no nearer Sitt Zeynab than we were at
first!”
</p>

<p>
“Look out, Count!” said Mr Hicks quickly. “Put that thing away, or the
Arabs will twig that it was not here for its health.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s just what I want. It’s no good mincing matters now. Put your
heads together and take a good squint at the thing, and then look as
angry and excited as you like, but say nothing to those fellows. After
supper we will have an ostentatiously serious talk.”
</p>

<p>
Quite in the dark as to Cyril’s intentions, the others nevertheless
obeyed him, casting glances of suspicion and dislike, which it needed
no dissimulation to render realistic, at the Arabs in the intervals of
picketing and rubbing down the horses and gathering sticks for the
fire. This change of demeanour did not pass unnoticed, and after their
frugal meal the hostile camps met separately in serious consultation.
Mr Hicks and Mansfield failed to receive the enlightenment they
expected and desired. Cyril let them say what they liked, but offered
no suggestions of his own, listening to all that was said with an air
of languor, almost of boredom.
</p>

<p>
“Tell the sheikh that I wish to speak to him in the morning before we
start, Hicks,” he said at last, and Mr Hicks obeyed, wondering.
</p>

<p>
“That the boss should give them free leave to vamoose the ranche in
the hours of darkness throws me out,” he said, and Mansfield
determined to balance this extraordinary failure of judgment on his
leader’s part by keeping watch on his own account all night. But a
hard day’s riding in sun and sand is not the best method of
preparation for a vigil, and not so very long after his usual hour
Mansfield was comfortably asleep. It was Cyril’s voice which aroused
his two companions from their dreamless slumbers.
</p>

<p>
“Mansfield! Hicks! wake up! Your revolvers!”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks was on the alert in a moment, revolver in hand. There was no
moon, and the fire was almost out, but his ear told him that the words
came from the neighbourhood of the horses, which were plunging and
kicking.
</p>

<p>
“Strike a light,” continued the voice, “and let’s see who it is I’ve
got here.”
</p>

<p>
The flickering gleam of the match showed that Cyril was holding the
loosened heel-rope of his own horse, while his revolver was pressed to
the forehead of the sheikh. The man was crouching on the ground in an
attitude which made it clear that he had been surprised when about to
release the other horses. Just outside the circle of the light the
dark forms of the two tribesmen were visible against the stars,
mounted and ready to ride away, but afraid of endangering their sheikh
if they attempted to attack Cyril. The sheikh’s own horse was close at
his heels.
</p>

<p>
“Is your revolver cocked, Hicks?” asked Cyril. “Mansfield, go and
fetch in the sheikh’s horse, but don’t fire unless I give the word.
Now, Hicks, ask the sheikh what he is doing here.”
</p>

<p>
“He says he never calculated to take you to Sitt Zeynab, Count,” said
Mr Hicks, receiving the sullen answers of the captive. “He and his
people have fixed up all the other travellers in this style, leading
them round and round until they were tired, and then sloping with
their horses. They were so glad to escape from the desert, when they
found their way out at last, that they never wanted to come back. He
says he saw that we suspected something last evening, and he concluded
it was time to travel.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell him,” said Cyril, smiling grimly, “that he may lead us round and
round as much as he likes, but he will have to take us to Sitt Zeynab
at last, unless he wishes to wander about with us for ever.”
</p>

<p>
“He says he guesses there’ll be some shooting first, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“I quite agree with him. Mansfield, cock your revolver, as loudly as
you can. Tell him that I shall have his horse and those of his men
shot if I hear much more of this.”
</p>

<p>
“You have him there, Count; but he says he can get fresh horses and
come back and lay you out.”
</p>

<p>
“Hardly,” was the suave reply. “I shall keep him and his men as guides
all the same; but they will have to walk.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t mind him, Count; he’s just relieving his feelings a bit, I
guess. It seems to hurt him real badly, the way he’s walked into this
trap of yours.”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh was groaning vigorously, and alternately muttering and
shouting imprecations in Arabic. At last he became somewhat calmer.
</p>

<p>
“What does the Prince of the Jews want?” he demanded of Mr Hicks.
</p>

<p>
“To get to Sitt Zeynab, and you may bet your boots he’ll do it.”
</p>

<p>
“What does he desire there?”
</p>

<p>
“According to the stars,” said Cyril solemnly, “the fate of your
Princess is linked with mine. If we meet, it will be a very good thing
for both of us; if not, great disasters will follow.”
</p>

<p>
“Say, Count, pile it on!” murmured Mr Hicks, in ecstasies of
admiration. “Guess I’ll most believe you myself soon. He says that
even if you get to Sitt Zeynab, that wouldn’t help you to see the
Princess or make a treaty with her.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell him I’ll take my chance of that.”
</p>

<p>
“He says the Princess is safe to imprison you and hold you to ransom.”
</p>

<p>
“Let her. I am going to Sitt Zeynab.”
</p>

<p>
“He concludes to give in, Count; but he is using improper language
about the day he inaugurated this personally conducted trip business.”
</p>

<p>
“Quite possible and very natural. Tell him to make his men dismount,
Hicks, and let one of them bring their horses over here. Then he can
go back with them to their side of the fire. Point out to him the
space between the horses and that rock over there. If any of them
cross that before daybreak we shall not hesitate to shoot. On the
march he himself will ride between you and Mansfield, his men in
single file in front of me.”
</p>

<p>
The contest was over, to the unbounded admiration of the Arabs, who
began to regard Cyril as a being little short of miraculous, since he
could see and hear in his sleep. That this feeling on their part was
to a certain extent a guarantee of safety to the travellers became
evident the next day, when a large body of mounted Arabs swooped down
upon the party as they approached the wells at which the unwilling
guides suggested a mid-day halt. It was clear that the new-comers were
prepared to congratulate their sheikh on his success in misleading a
fresh band of Roumi spies, and it was a shock to them to perceive that
the spies had not yet allowed themselves to be shaken off. The sheikh
displayed extreme tact in making the best of the situation. He
explained matters to his followers in a speech which was designed to
show that he was effecting a long-planned <i>coup</i> in carrying off the
Prince of the Jews to Sitt Zeynab to hold him to ransom, without so
much as allowing the captive to suspect that he was a prisoner. But
whether the sheikh’s hearers were equally accomplished liars with
himself, and thus naturally prone to discount his assertions, or
whether his two original followers failed to corroborate him as they
should, the awe with which Cyril was regarded spread quickly to the
larger circle. This was highly satisfactory, since, as Mr Hicks
pointed out to Mansfield, the tribe might easily have annihilated the
three intruders without a possibility of resistance, in one of the
paroxysms of powder-play and spear-flourishing with which they
celebrated the sheikh’s return. Portents began to multiply around
Cyril. At one time it was a stray stork, called by the Arabs the
father of luck, which stood meditatively behind him for some time,
undisturbed by the eager whispers around; at another a scorpion, which
had ensconced itself under one of his boots for the night. It left the
marks of its claws on his finger when he took up the boot in the
morning, but Mansfield killed it with a stone before it had time to
turn round and sting him.
</p>

<p>
Four days longer the march lasted, crossing a strip of desert more
sandy, stony, sunny, hot, and thirsty than any passed hitherto. This
pathless, waterless tract was the true defence of Sitt Zeynab, the
real reason why neither Roumi nor hostile tribesman had ever succeeded
in making his way thither. The Beni Ismail knew their desert as well
as if it had been traversed by a high road, but they economised their
stock of water and curtailed their halts as far as possible while they
were passing through it. This added discomfort pressed with special
severity upon those unaccustomed to desert travelling. Mr Hicks and
Mansfield, riding on in the baking sun hour after hour, with dry
mouths and parched tongues, were both heartily sick of the adventure;
but neither of them breathed a word of complaint or remonstrance to
Cyril. Nor&mdash;which was a far stronger testimony to their loyalty&mdash;did
they even exchange murmurs with one another; their nearest approach to
doing so was an occasional lament over the joys of civilisation. If a
bath was Mansfield’s ideal of unattainable happiness, Mr Hicks’s was a
sherry cobbler. His dreams, he averred, were haunted by the pleasant
tinkle of the ice in the glass, and as he lifted the straw to his
parched lips the thought would cross his mind that it was worth while
to have a real thirst on, for the pleasure of quenching it; but at
this point he invariably awoke. Cyril alone appeared unconscious of
the fresh hardships of this portion of the journey. Riding by himself,
he was nevertheless ready, when his companions addressed him, to
exchange with them the grim pleasantries which suited the situation.
It was clear, however, that his thoughts were not bounded by the
present scene, and Mr Hicks hazarded the suggestion that his brain was
evolving schemes of universal dominion. The Arabs viewed him with
ever-increasing respect, and it was with genuine awe that the sheikh
rode up to him one afternoon, and, pointing out a hill upon the
horizon, the summit of which seemed more regular in form than those on
either side, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Behold, O Prince of the Jews, the house of Sitt Zeynab!”
</p>

<p>
The response to the announcement was as alarming as it was unexpected.
Cyril fell forward unconscious upon his horse’s neck.
</p>

<p>
“Guessed it would come to this,” muttered Mr Hicks. “No, sheikh,” when
Mansfield and he had tried various remedies in vain, “it’s no good
trying to revive him out here. We must get him in somewhere cool and
shady, with plenty of water.”
</p>

<p>
“But why should the Prince of the Jews become as one dead when I show
him the house of Sitt Zeynab?” asked the sheikh.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Mr Hicks meditatively, for he was busy superintending the
construction of a litter from spears and cloaks, “I guess he thinks
you’ve kept him so long upon the road that he hasn’t much time to ward
off those disasters he spoke of from your Princess.”
</p>

<p>
Much subdued by this reply, the sheikh detailed four of his followers
to carry the litter, and ordered four others to be ready to relieve
them, betraying by such unexpected complaisance the ascendency which
Cyril had gained over his mind. Mansfield, in his deep anxiety,
dismounted and walked beside the litter, fearing lest the bearers
might stumble; but Mr Hicks laughed at him and maintained his position
beside the sheikh, with the cheering assurance that this period of
insensibility would ensure to Cyril the very rest his brain needed.
Mansfield had no attention to give to anything unconnected with the
patient, but the American’s restless eyes were everywhere. He noticed
the broken columns and other fragments of stonework which began to
make their appearance in the sand, and which showed that a
considerable town had once stood on this spot, looking for its defence
to the fortified hill of Sitt Zeynab. As he approached the fortress he
was able to distinguish that the massive wall enclosing the summit of
the hill bore evident traces of having been repaired at various
points, and probably at very varying dates, with masses of rock and
pieces of sculptured marble in place of its own bevelled stone. Above
the top of the wall a flat roof supported by pillars was just visible,
and at one corner stood a watch-tower of considerable height. Under
the shadow of the hill nestled a motley group of black tents and mud
huts, keeping guard over an oasis of moderate extent, the greenness of
which looked heaven-like to eyes wearied by the glare of the desert.
Palm-groves and leafy thickets marked the course of a stream, and
fringed the borders of the marsh in which it terminated, and Mr Hicks
perceived at once that some attempt was made to cultivate corn and
melons with the help of irrigation. The water, the sheikh told him,
came from hidden springs in the heart of the hill, and served to keep
filled an underground reservoir, for use in the event of a siege,
before it was allowed to issue forth into the plain. This information
was given as the travellers began to mount the zigzag path which led
to the gateway of the fortress. It was evident that their approach had
been observed, for one of the heavy doors stood open, and a woman,
wrapped from head to foot in a white veil, had stepped outside to
await them.
</p>

<p>
“Is that the Princess?” asked Mr Hicks of the sheikh, looking up at
the white figure with involuntary awe.
</p>

<p>
“Nay, it is only her scribe, but she also is a great woman, one in
whom is much wisdom, and the Princess is guided by her counsels. The
<i>khawaja</i> will see her eyes like the clouds when the snow is falling
upon Lebanon, but I who speak to him have seen them black like the sky
in a midnight without stars. That is when the Princess is in great
straits.”
</p>

<p>
“But what sort of difficulties does the Princess get into?” asked Mr
Hicks curiously. The sheikh drew nearer, and spoke confidentially.
</p>

<p>
“There was a time, <i>Khawaja</i>, when I with certain of the tribe was
escorting the Princess and her women to Sitt Zeynab. On a sudden we
beheld a great host riding swiftly against us, with every sign of war.
Then I cried out, loudly, and with intent to deceive the women, ‘Lo!
it is the Beni Ayub who have heard that we are ruled by a woman, and
are coming to swallow us up.’ But when I looked to see the Princess
blench, she cried, as the scribe told us, ‘Let us have no bloodshed! I
will go and speak with them,’ and beckoning to the scribe, she urged
on her horse. But the scribe cried to me, ‘Stop the Princess! If aught
befall her, it were better for thee and thy tribe never to have been
born,’ and she dashed forward by herself. Then it was that I saw her
eyes black as Iblis, but it was not with fear, for she rode straight
up to those who came against us, and spoke boldly to them, I holding
fast to the Princess’s bridle, although she cursed me and struck at me
with her whip. But when the scribe reached the enemy, behold! they
were not the Beni Ayub at all, but the rest of our own tribe, come to
greet the Princess. And all the tribe said, ‘Lo! the spirit of a man
is in these women. It is no shame to be ruled by them,’ and we were
content.”
</p>

<p>
“And the ladies&mdash;were they content when they twigged your little
joke?” asked Mr Hicks.
</p>

<p>
“Nay, the scribe spoke very freely to us all. But who cares for a
woman’s tongue?”
</p>

<p>
“It don’t seem to strike you that it was a queer dodge to play tricks
of that sort on your Princess, sheikh. Was it just at the beginning of
her reign?”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh looked straight at Mr Hicks with blank, expressionless
eyes. His burst of confidence was clearly at an end. “This is the door
of the house of Sitt Zeynab, and here is the scribe of the Great
Princess,” he said. “Peace be upon thee, O lady!”
</p>

<p>
“And upon thee be peace!” replied the veiled woman, in Arabic. “Are
the Princess’s letters with thee?”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh took a leather bag from the front of his saddle, where it
had excited the unavailing curiosity of his guests throughout the
journey, and presented it respectfully.
</p>

<p>
“The Princess perceived that one of thy men was being carried in a
litter, and she desired to know what had happened, and whether he was
badly hurt. But who are these?” There was a wild alarm in her voice,
as she caught sight of the travel-stained Norfolk suits of Mr Hicks
and Mansfield, whose uniform of <i>abba</i> and <i>kaffiyeh</i> had rendered
them until this moment indistinguishable from the Arabs, and she
staggered back against the door-post.
</p>

<p>
“O lady, these men are the servants of the Prince of the Jews, whom we
have brought hither from Es Sham to see what is the will of the
Princess concerning him. He professes much goodwill towards our tribe,
desiring to enter into a treaty with the great lady, and we have
perceived that he is a lucky person.”
</p>

<p>
“Where is he? Let me see him.” The bearers of the litter had deposited
their burden upon the ground, and she bent forward to look at it. A
convulsive shiver ran through her frame, and she sprang back as though
she had seen a snake. “<i>That</i> man?” she ejaculated, and Mr Hicks and
Mansfield both observed that her grey eyes, the only feature visible
between the folds of her veil, were dilated by anger or horror until
the black alone was visible. “O son of misfortune, why hast thou
brought him here? He is the Princess’s deadliest enemy, the man that
has most injured her in all the world.”
</p>

<p>
“It may be that he desires to make atonement, O lady,” suggested the
sheikh deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
“To make atonement&mdash;he? Nay, rather to do more mischief,” and she
bestowed a dainty but vicious kick upon Cyril’s unconscious form.
“Take him and his companions to the vaults, O sheikh, and keep them
there safely until they shall return to their own country.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, madam; if you would allow me a few words with you&mdash;&mdash;” Mr
Hicks came forward politely, and spoke in his best Arabic, but he was
in difficulties with his <i>kaffiyeh</i>, which he had naturally tried to
take off on addressing a lady. The heavy gold-worked handkerchief had
become mixed up with the twisted cord which held it to the head, and
the consciousness that he was appearing at a disadvantage embarrassed
Mr Hicks seriously.
</p>

<p>
“I will not listen. Take them away. Let no more be seen of them!”
cried the lady, escaping into the fortress and shutting the door
behind her.
</p>

<p>
“What a fiend!” ejaculated Mansfield, with blazing eyes, as the rattle
of bolts and bars showed that there was no hope of changing her mind.
</p>

<p>
“Excitable female, any way,” said Mr Hicks, his equanimity restored.
“Well, sheikh, I guess you had better march us off to these vaults of
yours. See what a pity it is that the Prince of the Jews wasn’t on
hand to blarney the lady!”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh assented gloomily, and giving an order to his followers,
they retraced their steps and descended the path.
</p>

<p>
“Of course you saw that our fair friend was a European?” remarked Mr
Hicks to Mansfield, as they followed the litter.
</p>

<p>
“What, that woman&mdash;that&mdash;that creature?”
</p>

<p>
“The lady who just honoured us with her attention. She wore Paris
shoes, any way, and a rustling frill round the edge of her gown.”
</p>

<p>
“I should think she has very good reasons for living out here, then,”
was the unchivalrous remark of Mansfield, for the insult offered to
Cyril had made his blood boil.
</p>

<p>
“Now that I would call one of the hasty judgments of youth,” drawled
Mr Hicks, and said no more until they arrived at the entrance to their
prison, which proved to be a cave at the foot of the hill, approached
by a low doorway almost buried in the sand. A man was sent to the
village for spades, and the sand was shovelled away until a large flat
stone, standing more or less perpendicularly, was laid bare. This
rested on rough hinges cut in the rock, and opened inwards like a
door. All was dark inside, but it seemed cool and airy. Mr Hicks
struck a match. Furniture there was none, with the exception of
various heaps of broken pottery and fragments of rock, and what seemed
a series of colossal bookshelves lining the walls.
</p>

<p>
“Look here, sheikh,” said the American, “you’ve got to give us food
and lights, and some tent-cloth to sleep on, if you run this
high-class hotel.”
</p>

<p>
“What will the Princess say?” was the lugubrious reply.
</p>

<p>
“What will she say when the Prince of the Jews speaks with her and
tells her how badly you treated us?”
</p>

<p>
“It shall be done, <i>Khawaja</i>,” and the sheikh gave the necessary
orders, which resulted in the arrival soon afterwards of three native
lamps, with a supply of oil, some fresh bread and a further provision
of the detestable compound of dates, and three pieces of goat’s-hair
cloth. Meanwhile, Mansfield had been laboriously bringing in sand, a
spadeful at a time, thus forming a substructure on which one of the
tent-cloths was laid to make a bed for Cyril. Then the door was shut,
and the prisoners were left to their reflections.
</p>

<p>
“They may call this place the house of the Lady Zenobia as much as
they like,” said Mr Hicks aggressively, “but I’ll stick out that it
was the Lady Zenobia’s burying-lot, no less.”
</p>

<p>
“This place&mdash;a mausoleum?” asked Mansfield, with marked disgust.
</p>

<p>
“I guess so. Look at those shelves&mdash;all empty, of course; but there’s
a choice collection of miscellaneous remains in the room down the
passage there, where the light comes in through a hole in the roof.
The Arabs have rifled the place, you bet, and lugged the corpses into
daylight that they might be sure of missing nothing. All mummied, of
course, so you needn’t look so sick.”
</p>

<p>
“But we can’t stay here!” cried Mansfield, in horror.
</p>

<p>
“I guess we’ve got to. The lady upstairs don’t calculate to be trifled
with, you see. But I’ve slept in many worse locations than this, for
it’s clear that the last interment took place several hundreds of
thousands of years back, so the deceased won’t interfere with our
physical comfort; and if you see a ghost, just hurry up and tell me,
and I’ll interview him for the ‘Crier.’ Suppose you fly around and fix
things up for the night now. Our supper don’t need much cooking,
unfortunately, but the water’s good, any way. You might put out two of
those lamps, for it’s past sundown, and I’d as lief keep a light going
all night. Guess we’ll fix up one of these pieces of tent-cloth to
keep off the draught from that passage. I’m going to sit up with the
boss, so I’m better without a bed.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Mansfield, “I’m going to look after him.”
</p>

<p>
“Young man,” said Mr Hicks firmly, “this is my funeral. Your turn will
come to-morrow night, but as the distinguished sufferer’s medical
attendant, I calculate to do my obvious duty to-night. The boss is
taking a fine spell of rest just now, breathing natural, pulse
regular, everything first-rate, but I must be on hand when he wakes
up. Now don’t turn nasty, or I’ll sit up next night as well. I’m a
peaceable man, but when I get riz, there’s likely to be
unpleasantness.”
</p>

<p>
Accepting the inevitable with the worst possible grace, Mansfield
prepared the supper, assisted in hanging the curtain, and finally
betook himself to his couch of hair cloth, where he muffled his head
in his cloak in the way he had learnt from the Arabs, and was fast
asleep in two minutes. He slept until late the next day, and was only
awakened by the voices of Cyril and Mr Hicks, as they expressed their
heartfelt admiration of his powers of slumber, and suggested
exhibiting him to the Arabs as one of the Seven Sleepers. Cyril was in
the wildest spirits. The fatigue of the journey seemed to have
altogether passed away, and Mr Hicks’s account of the lady at the
gateway and her ungracious behaviour had filled him with delight. Mr
Hicks, on the contrary, was more silent than usual, and offered
presently to show Mansfield a rock-cut swimming-bath, supplied with
water from the reservoir of which the Arabs had spoken, which he had
discovered while exploring one of the passages branching from the
cave. After a few moments’ silence, as they groped their way between
the rocky walls, he turned suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Mansfield, do I look like a man that would see ghosts?”
</p>

<p>
“No, I should say not,” replied Mansfield, holding up the lamp to
scrutinise his companion’s features; “but you look as if you had seen
one now,” he added maliciously.
</p>

<p>
“That is so, Mr Mansfield. Or I have seen an apparition of a
surprising character, any way. About midnight I was sitting on a rock
beside the boss, and figuring out what I might clear by transporting
to the States that whole cargo of damaged Palmyrene antiquities in the
cellar back of ours, and selling them in small quantities to local
museums, when I distinctly saw that curtain move that we fixed up. You
bet I kept my eyes nailed on it. Well, it was drawn back slightly, and
there was an old woman&mdash;a little old woman&mdash;standing in the passage,
wrapped in a white sheet, like our friend at the door above, but I
could see her whole face. She never saw me, for the light was between
us; but she took a step forward and looked at the boss. I guess I was
hasty, but I cocked my six-shooter. She heard me, and in the minutest
fraction of a second she was gone. I caught up the light, and made
tracks after her, but there was nothing to be seen. I searched every
inch of the passage and the cave where the remains are, but she wasn’t
there, and there is no means of getting out that way, unless she
slithered up the roof to the hole where the light comes in, and that
isn’t what you would expect of an elderly female of respectable
appearance.”
</p>

<p>
“But was she a European, as you said the other one was?”
</p>

<p>
“Can’t say, Mr Mansfield. One old woman is pretty much like another.
Maybe she was the ghost of the Lady Zenobia. If that is so, I’ve lost
the best chance a newspaper man ever had, and I can tell you I feel
real mean.”
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Mansfield, with ungenerous exultation, “I can tell you
something, and that is, it’s <i>my</i> funeral to-night. You haven’t said
anything to the Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Do I look such a fool as all that, sir? But I’m real down. You could
most trample on me. I guess I ought to shove you into the
swimming-bath for your impudence, and I would do it, too, if it wasn’t
that maybe you would catch cold,” and having launched this Parthian
shaft, Mr Hicks departed.
</p>

<p>
When Mansfield returned to the cave, he found that Cyril was giving
audience to the sheikh, who had come to announce their fate to the
prisoners. They need cherish no hope of being admitted to the presence
of the Princess, or even to an interview with her secretary. The doors
of the fortress were irrevocably closed against them, and they would
remain in their gloomy prison until they chose to return to
civilisation, when they would be escorted across the desert and set
down in the neighbourhood of Damascus. The sheikh’s mental discomfort
as he made this announcement was very evident, and it was clear that
he feared Cyril’s wrath only less than that of his sovereign; but the
placid smile with which his message was received served to reassure
him, and he retired puzzled but contented. Cyril remained in high
spirits all day, his gaiety only increasing towards evening. It was in
vain that Mr Hicks attempted to write to his paper, and that Mansfield
sat down resolutely with the intention of renovating the clothes of
the party, for he gave them no peace. He had a plan, which he
persisted in setting before them, conceived in the regulation
boys’-book-of-adventure style, for overpowering the sheikh and the
guard outside the cave, and scaling the walls of the fortress by the
aid of rope-ladders made of twisted strips of hair-cloth, thus
literally “dropping in” on the Princess with an urgency that would
admit of no denial. He seemed unable to turn his mind to anything
else, and at last Mr Hicks took the matter into his own hands.
</p>

<p>
“Say, Count,” he observed, as he returned, carrying a tray, from a
colloquy at the prison-door with some person unknown, “I guess it’s my
duty as your medical adviser to warn you against all this excitement.
Now here’s some real good coffee that the sheikh has sent us, and I’ve
concluded to allow you a cup if you’ll do your level best to sleep
after it, but otherwise not so much as a drop.”
</p>

<p>
“Tyrant!” groaned Cyril. “You know that two days ago we should have
been thankful to get drinkable water, but that, having got it, the
soul of man refuses to be satisfied without coffee, especially when
you tantalise him with the smell. Well, I give in.” He took the cup
and sipped it, but his tone changed immediately. “Hicks, you villain!
you’ve put some beastly stuff into this coffee.”
</p>

<p>
“Just to make you sure of a night’s rest, Count. How do you intend to
go on the bust to-morrow if you don’t sleep?”
</p>

<p>
The narcotic produced the desired effect, and before long Cyril was
sleeping as soundly as he had done the night before. As soon as this
had become evident, Mansfield jumped up.
</p>

<p>
“Now then, Hicks, off you go!” he said, “and no keeping awake, mind.
Honour bright!”
</p>

<p>
“Honest Injun!” assented Mr Hicks, accepting his dismissal to the
recess which Mansfield had occupied the night before. “Guess I
couldn’t keep awake if I tried, any way. But mind, you’re to call me
if there’s any spiritual manifestation.”
</p>

<p>
“If I can do it without disturbing the manifestation,” agreed
Mansfield, and went on with his preparations for observing, in a
thoroughly scientific spirit, any phenomenon that might occur. He
looped back the curtain which had been hung over the entrance to the
passage, and arranged his bed directly opposite the opening, so that
he could command both sides of the passage as far as the light of the
lamp would extend. The lamp itself he placed in such a position that
he himself was left in shadow, while the eyes of any intruder would be
dazzled. Then he wrapped himself in his cloak, leaving a peep-hole
through which he could see without being seen, lay down with his
cocked revolver in his hand, and waited.
</p>

<p>
He waited so long, with every sense on the alert, yet disturbed only
by purely imaginary noises, that he rebuked himself impatiently when
it seemed to him that he felt a breath of cold air in his face, and
that he heard at the same moment a slight rustle. But no, this time
there was no delusion. From the darkness of the passage emerged the
little old woman of whom Mr Hicks had spoken. She gave a quick glance
round the cave, then turned her head for a moment, and a taller woman,
also wrapped in the swathing white draperies, followed her out into
the light. Mansfield’s heart stood still as the two white figures
moved softly to Cyril’s side, and stood looking down at him. Could
they intend to murder him? But even as he raised his revolver
noiselessly to cover them, the taller woman’s veil dropped from her
face, and he saw that her hands were clasped convulsively on her
breast. Still she stood looking down at the sleeper, until her
companion touched her gently, when, to Mansfield’s utter bewilderment,
she stooped and kissed Cyril softly on the forehead. The old woman
drew her away, and they vanished.
</p>

CHAPTER XVII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">FACE TO FACE.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">Mansfield</span>, was any one in here last night?”
</p>

<p>
“Why&mdash;er&mdash;how do you mean, Count? Oh, when the sheikh’s son brought
the coffee?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, much later than that. Was there any one?”
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;I suppose there must have been. I don’t know.”
</p>

<p>
“But why do you suppose so? because I ask you, or because you saw some
one? Why can’t you say?”
</p>

<p>
“Because I am not sure. I saw something.”
</p>

<p>
“But what could it have been if it was not a person? a ghost?”
</p>

<p>
An embarrassed laugh from Mansfield revealed that the chance shot had
hit the mark, and Cyril’s eyes gleamed with mischievous delight.
</p>

<p>
“Come, this is interesting! Let us hear about it.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, I saw&mdash;at least, I thought I saw&mdash;two ladies come into
the cave from the passage and look at you.”
</p>

<p>
“How flattering! Did you see their faces?”
</p>

<p>
“The first lady was old and bent. I think Mr Hicks caught sight of her
the night before, and frightened her away. There was nothing
particular about her face. The other was taller, but not really tall.
She let her veil fall when she was standing beside you, and I saw that
her hair was white, but her face looked quite young&mdash;comparatively.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them again slowly.
“And did she do nothing but look at me?”
</p>

<p>
“She clasped her hands&mdash;like this. I don’t know whether it was because
she was glad or sorry.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that all? You are sure there was nothing else?”
</p>

<p>
“She&mdash;she stooped down and&mdash;and kissed you, Count.” Mansfield’s
abashed voice would have provoked his auditor to laughter at any other
moment, but now Cyril only nodded approvingly.
</p>

<p>
“I thought I couldn’t have dreamt it. And after that?”
</p>

<p>
“They slipped back into the passage, and disappeared suddenly. I can’t
find any door through which they could have gone.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, we can think of that presently. I am heartily obliged to you,
Mansfield. It’s a comfort to have a man about one who can tell his
tale sensibly, without interlarding it with wretched feeble jokes. Any
one could make a joke of this affair, no doubt, but not when it is
looked at in the proper light. Of course you know who the lady is?”
</p>

<p>
“I, Count?” Mansfield’s astonished face attested his ignorance
sufficiently.
</p>

<p>
“It has never once struck you that the Queen of the Desert and Queen
Ernestine are one and the same person? Nor that one of the letters
which the sheikh carried in that leather bag of his was from Fräulein
von Staubach, and contained the news of your invasion of Brutli, and
identified me with the Prince of the Jews?”
</p>

<p>
“But how long have you known it? and why didn’t you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Share my knowledge with you? Because I thought that you and Hicks
deserved a little punishment for mixing yourselves up in my affairs. I
have not known the truth long, of course. When Fräulein von Staubach
told you that she could not mention my name to the Queen for a
fortnight, that set me on the track. Some time ago I chanced to hear
that the Queen had held out for a whole fortnight before she would
consent to see some one. Of course she was being sent for from here.
When the coincidence had once flashed upon my mind, everything was
clear&mdash;the Queen’s persistent isolation on the one hand, and the
extraordinary proceedings of the Arab Princess on the other. The
rescue of the persecuted tribe, the idea of obtaining the mediation of
the Empress of Pannonia&mdash;who is Queen Ernestine’s sister-in-law&mdash;and
the threatened appeal to the Powers, are all characteristic of her.
Then you know that no one ever heard of the Queen of the Desert until
two years ago, which corresponds roughly with the time Queen Ernestine
disappeared from the public gaze. My hypothesis accounted for all the
facts, and you see it was correct.”
</p>

<p>
“But how can you be sure, when you didn’t see the lady last night?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled impatiently. “My dear Mansfield, I felt she was there.
That’s enough for me. Did Hicks see her?”
</p>

<p>
“No, he was asleep.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I think you need only mention to him that you saw his old lady
of the night before. Hicks is a good fellow enough, but there are
times when he would sell his soul to purchase a sensation for his
paper. It is just like the Queen to have made this midnight
expedition, but you needn’t&mdash;I don’t want&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I understand,” said Mansfield hastily. “He shall never hear about
it from me.”
</p>

<p>
“And now, Mansfield, we will make a searching investigation of the
walls of the passage. I want to find that secret door through which
the ladies came and went, and then we will pay them a visit.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks, returning at this moment from conferring with the sheikh on
the subject of a change of food for the party, was duly informed of
the reappearance of his ghost, and joined with extreme zeal in the
hunt for the door, although a close observer might have perceived that
when his face was turned away from the others it underwent a series of
extraordinary contortions, suggestive of suppressed mirth. For some
time the search was fruitless, the smooth surface of the rock on both
sides of the passage displaying no indication of any joint or crack,
even when examined minutely with the aid of a lamp.
</p>

<p>
“Mansfield,” said Cyril at last, “lie down where you were last night,
and tell me exactly how far the lady had got when she disappeared.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield obeyed, and was able to indicate the spot with tolerable
precision, by estimating its distance from the edge of the curtain.
</p>

<p>
“Now, Hicks,” said Cyril, “the lamp here, please. I think we may be
pretty sure that the door is in the left-hand wall, as that is the
side on which the hill is, and I should imagine we shall find the
spring two or three feet either to the right or the left of the point
at which the lady vanished.”
</p>

<p>
He began to test the wall by pressing it carefully with his fingers,
keeping his left hand a few inches higher than his right, and before
very long Mr Hicks gave a shout.
</p>

<p>
“You’ve hit it, Count! I saw something give that time, and here’s a
break in the wall ahead of you. Guess you’d better let me help you
shove.”
</p>

<p>
But the stone door moved so easily upon its pivot that this was
unnecessary. It swung open without the slightest sound, revealing the
foot of a flight of steps cut in the rock.
</p>

<p>
“Now this is what I call real thoughtful of the Lady Zenobia,” said Mr
Hicks. “If she found it necessary to assist a friend into the next
world, there was no need to have corpses lying around upstairs. She
could plant them out in her lot down here quite comfortably, and no
one the wiser.”
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said Cyril, panting a little, “you and I will make a voyage of
discovery, Mansfield. Do you know, Hicks, I think your nocturnal
visitor must be an old acquaintance of mine, Baroness von Hilfenstein?
I needn’t tell you in whose household she is, and you won’t be
surprised to hear that I intend to make a call on her.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t calculate to leave me out of the party, Count, I hope?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m afraid I must on this occasion. Who is to receive the sheikh and
bamboozle him as to our doings, if we all go? He would scour the
passages, thinking we were trying to escape, and we should be brought
back before we could do anything.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s so, sir. Go ahead,” and Mr Hicks got out his fountain pen and
his writing-pad, and set to work on a letter to his paper, while
Mansfield, by Cyril’s directions, made himself as smart as his
extremely limited resources allowed. His employer was one of those
fortunate people who contrive always to be presentable in spite of the
most adverse circumstances, but he displayed unwonted anxiety about
his appearance on this occasion, and Mr Hicks smiled grimly as he
closed the stone door upon the flickering light carried by Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“You ought to have known me better, Count. As if all this prinking
wouldn’t tell me what was on hand even if I hadn’t used my eyes last
night! You deserve I should make a real blood-curdling,
soul-thrilling, romantic, pathetic life-drama out of you and your
Queen, but you and I are partners, and I’m on the square, any way.”
</p>

<p>
The rock-cut staircase up which Cyril and Mansfield made their way was
narrow and winding, but quite dry, and the edges of the stone were as
sharp as if they had only been hewn a day. Air was admitted from the
outer world by means of shafts reaching to the face of the rock, but
these were too small to allow the entrance of more than a ray of
light, which served to increase by contrast the surrounding darkness.
A quantity of sand, admitted in the course of ages through these
air-shafts, was heaped in the corners, but Cyril pointed out to
Mansfield that the flowing robes of the nocturnal visitors had swept a
clear pathway in the middle of the steps. The two men went on, up and
up, now turning to the right and now to the left, sometimes finding
themselves on ground which was almost level, and again confronted with
steps nearly two feet high, until there was a change in the sound of
their echoing footsteps, and they discovered that instead of solid
rock the walls and roof were now of masonry.
</p>

<p>
“This is the wall of the fortress, then!” said Cyril. “Interesting
question where we shall come out&mdash;in the palace itself, or hopelessly
outside.”
</p>

<p>
He was hot and panting, and his voice vibrated strangely. Mansfield
suggested a rest, but he shook his head. “No, no,” he said
impatiently; “let us go through with it now, and know the worst.”
</p>

<p>
The passage ended abruptly in a stone door like that by which they had
left the cave. Mansfield pushed it open, cautiously at first, for in
the blinding glare of sunlight into which it admitted them they could
not at once see where they were. Then came disappointment. True, they
stood inside the circuit of the vast wall visible from the plain, but
before them loomed the huge side of the palace, blank and windowless,
built of immense blocks of bevelled stone. Travelling upwards from one
course of Cyclopean masonry to another, the eye could discover no
opening into the interior of the building until it reached the
colonnade supported on columns which crowned the roof. Between the
palace and the outer wall was a space of waste ground overgrown with
coarse dry grass and low bushes, and Mansfield crept softly among the
scattered rocks and fragments of carved stone, which lay everywhere
around, towards the back of the building, and peered round the corner.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing there but a few servants’ huts and attempts at
gardening&mdash;certainly no door into the palace,” he whispered,
returning.
</p>

<p>
“Very well, we will try this way,” said Cyril, turning to the right,
but here again was disappointment. The entrance to the palace was
before them, indeed&mdash;a huge pillared portico with great stone doors;
but these were as closely shut as the wooden gate facing them, which
the angry lady had fastened behind her two days before. A small grated
window above the door was the only opening here, and it was far beyond
even Mansfield’s reach. But Cyril did not exhibit any sign of
discouragement.
</p>

<p>
“Take one,” he said, sitting down at the base of one of the columns
and holding out his cigar-case. “There are only two left, but Sir
Philip Sidney’s generosity was nothing to mine when there is anything
to be gained by it. What I want to gain just now is an interview with
the lady of the gateway, whom I take to be Princess Anna Mirkovics.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield obeyed, much puzzled, and they smoked in silence for some
minutes. Then a female voice, speaking in German, broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
“Those servants again!” it said. “How often have I forbidden them to
smoke in the neighbourhood of the Queen’s apartments! They know how
much she dislikes the smell. Which of them can it be?”
</p>

<p>
“Drawn!” whispered Cyril. “Though it is a little hard to have one’s
best cigars mistaken for the stuff these fellows smoke, isn’t it?”
</p>

<p>
“Markor! Zachary! Johannes! which of you is smoking out there?” cried
the voice, which Mansfield recognised as that of the lady of the
gateway, in Arabic, and her face appeared at the window. She recoiled
precipitately when she saw Cyril, who bowed to her with the utmost
politeness.
</p>

<p>
“You here!” she cried, her eyes dilating as they had done before.
“What do you want?”
</p>

<p>
“An audience of her Majesty, mademoiselle.”
</p>

<p>
“I thought so. I felt sure you would come cringing back to the woman
you had wronged, but you shall not see her. I will not have her made
miserable a second time by you.”
</p>

<p>
“Mademoiselle, I acknowledge you readily as a true prophet&mdash;I will
even confess that your reproaches are deserved&mdash;but it lies with her
Majesty, and not with you, to grant or refuse me an interview.”
</p>

<p>
“It does lie with me. I refuse to submit your request to her Majesty,
do you understand? I take upon myself the responsibility of excluding
you from her presence. You shall not tear open the cruel wound you
once made. I will have you dragged back again to your prison.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, mademoiselle. I am master of the situation at present, for
I fancy the Arabs would obey my orders&mdash;perhaps as readily as your
own. In any case, the sounds of a scuffle would attract the Queen’s
attention.”
</p>

<p>
“I have no fear of the fidelity of the Arabs, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“Then pray test it, mademoiselle. I ask merely that my presence here
should come to her Majesty’s knowledge. Her pleasure is my law. If she
refuses to grant me an audience, I will go away without another word.”
</p>

<p>
“Then consider that she has refused it, for it will not be granted. I
am bold enough to risk her Majesty’s displeasure when it falls to me
to guard her happiness. You need not hope to move me by an air of
meekness, of suffering. Pray remain there in the sun the whole day. I
rejoice to see you shut out&mdash;unable to reach her. Nothing could please
me better.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, mademoiselle, there is one thing wanting to complete your
enjoyment. If her Majesty rejoiced to see me shut out, then you could
be happy indeed. But you are afraid to lay my request before her,
because you know that she would grant it.”
</p>

<p>
“I cannot stand talking all day,” said the lady angrily. “You, Count,
have doubtless plenty of time to spare. I hope you may enjoy
yourself!”
</p>

<p>
She disappeared from the grating, and all through the long, hot,
noonday hours Cyril held his ground, with Mansfield, as determined as
himself, at his side. Recommended to find his way back to the cave and
take counsel with Mr Hicks, Mansfield refused to leave his post in the
portico. With the nature of the grudge that Princess Anna Mirkovics
cherished against Count Mortimer he was unacquainted; but she seemed
to have little regard for consequences provided she could obtain her
revenge. In the course of the afternoon she appeared again at the
window, fresh from a cool siesta&mdash;so, with a refinement of cruelty,
she informed them&mdash;and jeered at Cyril’s persistence in remaining
where he was not wanted, and where he could do no good. Even Mansfield
grew fainthearted after this. Cyril’s paleness and evident exhaustion
alarmed him, and he suggested a retreat to the cave and the employment
of Mr Hicks as ambassador. But Cyril was resolute.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll stay here till I get in, or die on her doorstep!” he said
fiercely, and Mansfield offered no further suggestions. Their patience
met with its reward at last, although this would scarcely have
happened had Princess Anna been able to resist informing Cyril that
the Queen was about to spend the evening in the garden, and he might
therefore give up the hope of attracting her attention. Scarcely had
she departed when another face appeared at the grating, that of
Baroness von Hilfenstein, coming to see who it was that had been
conversing in French with her colleague.
</p>

<p>
“You here, Count!” she said, with reproachful incredulity. “This is
a&mdash;a&mdash;an unpleasant surprise.”
</p>

<p>
“Baroness, you are very cruel, when I have spent the whole day here in
the hope of catching a glimpse of you.”
</p>

<p>
“You can hardly expect me to believe that, Count.”
</p>

<p>
“Even though you know you are going to get me an interview with the
Queen?”
</p>

<p>
The Baroness threw up her hands. “Not that, Count, not that!” she
pleaded piteously. “You would not make such an inexpedient, ill-timed
request?”
</p>

<p>
“But I do make exactly that request, Baroness. One word with her
Majesty&mdash;that will tell me all I want to know.”
</p>

<p>
“But, my dear Count,” said the old lady persuasively, “you must really
be patient. Her Majesty was quite gratified&mdash;yes, I think I may
without impropriety use the word&mdash;to hear from Fräulein von Staubach
that you were anxious to wait upon her, and I think it is extremely
probable that she will command your presence when the Court returns to
Brutli. But now&mdash;I really could not say how she would receive this
unfortunate application of yours!”
</p>

<p>
“I will take my chance of that, Baroness. And here I stay until you
assure me that her Majesty positively refuses to receive me.”
</p>

<p>
“Now, Count, be reasonable.” The Baroness was much distressed by
Cyril’s persistence. “I am sure you don’t wish to involve her Majesty
in any unpleasantness? And poor dear Princess Anna, who has made such
sacrifices, and shown such devotion to the Queen, would almost break
her heart if she saw you received in audience. You see, she does not
even know of Fräulein von Staubach’s letter&mdash;I happened to be in
attendance when her Majesty opened it, and we thought it better to&mdash;to
spare her feelings. Of course you understand?”
</p>

<p>
“Am I to understand that Princess Anna’s feelings will be considered
before mine? I know I have not deserved consideration, but&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Her Majesty is all consideration, Count. She knows that the Prince of
the Jews is here, for one of the Armenian servants heard it from the
Arabs, but she believes you think she is at Brutli. She is able to
identify the Prince of the Jews, but she does not know that you have
found out who the Queen of the Desert is.”
</p>

<p>
“I see,” said Cyril meditatively. “Then this explains why you played
the ghost the night before last, Baroness&mdash;and last night also?”
</p>

<p>
“Count!” The poor Baroness renounced the unequal struggle. “You knew
it all the time, then? I was over-persuaded&mdash;her Majesty insisted&mdash;I
was horrified, but still&mdash;Oh, come in, Count,” she began to unfasten
the door. “You must say what you like to the Queen. I might have known
that if you were determined to get in you would. Will your&mdash;your suite
accompany you?” glancing doubtfully at Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid I shall need his arm,” said Cyril, with a laugh. He was
shaking from head to foot as Mansfield helped him through the doorway
and across the paved hall into which it led. The Baroness, in a state
of extreme trepidation, went before them, turning at every few steps
to hasten them on, or warn them not to speak, but they met no one. A
door at the farther end of the long hall led into an inner courtyard,
which was partially laid out as a garden, and surrounded by a
half-ruined colonnade, entwined with gourds and other creeping plants.
In the shade of the dwarf palms and shrubs at the opposite side could
be seen two white-robed figures.
</p>

<p>
“Her Majesty walks here in the evenings,” said the Baroness, with a
gasp of uncontrollable excitement, “and Princess Anna is with her.
When they pass this doorway you must do what you think best,” and she
fled back into the hall.
</p>

<p>
“Mansfield! when she comes, help me to kneel down, and then make
yourself scarce,” said Cyril breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
He was gripping Mansfield’s arm hard as they stood in the shadow of
the doorway, and the two women, unconscious of their presence, came
slowly towards them. Anna Mirkovics seemed to be talking excitedly,
regardless of etiquette, but the Queen paid little or no attention to
her, pacing the time-worn stones in silence, with her eyes on the
ground, and a half-smile upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
“Surely, madame, you were not really thinking of returning to Brutli
at present?” cried her companion, as they turned the corner.
</p>

<p>
“Now!” panted Cyril to Mansfield, and as the Queen approached he fell
on his knees before her. She started back, and Anna Mirkovics
screamed. Mansfield had retreated swiftly into the doorway.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Cyril</i>!” cried the Queen, irrepressible joy in her voice; then, more
doubtfully, “Is it you, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“My dearest, forgive me!”
</p>

<p>
“Madame!” Anna Mirkovics had recovered herself, “allow me to have this
person removed. Is he to be permitted to intrude himself upon you in
this insolent manner? Madame, you will not suffer him to approach
you?”
</p>

<p>
“Anna, you forget yourself.” The maid of honour shrank before the
tone, and the gesture with which the Queen waved her aside, but she
made another valiant effort.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, madame, listen to me for one moment! You know how I love
you&mdash;that I would give everything I have in the world to provide a
moment’s happiness for you. Don’t expose yourself again to this man’s
cruelty. He returns to you merely that he may gratify his ambition. He
cannot love. Trust me, madame; I love you better than my life.”
</p>

<p>
“I am in your hands, Ernestine,” said Cyril faintly. “If you command
me to leave you, I will go at once.”
</p>

<p>
“To leave me, when I have been waiting years for you? I knew you would
come back, Cyril, but I was often sick with longing. Go, Anna; you do
not understand. If Count Mortimer were to forsake me again to-morrow,
I would welcome him now.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, my dearest, I have not deserved this!” broke from Cyril. “That
day&mdash;that day&mdash;when you knelt to me, and I would not listen&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t, don’t!” murmured the Queen painfully. “I can’t bear to
remember it. Oh, Cyril, you would not even send me a kind word! You
did not know how I loved you, or you could not have been so cruel.”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t even know how I loved you, Ernestine. I thought it was all
over, but I have never had a happy moment since.”
</p>

<p>
“I am so glad!” she replied, with a radiant smile. “That is selfish of
me, isn’t it? but I was always jealous of your policy, you know.
Cyril, my beloved, if you knew how I have prayed for this day! I used
to wish that I might die, because I thought you would come to me if I
was dying. But now&mdash;oh, I am too happy! No, you are not to kiss my
hands. Come and sit here, and tell me what you have been doing all
these years.”
</p>

<p>
A despairing groan at his side made Mansfield start, as he stood in
the shadowy hall, out of earshot of the garden. Turning quickly, he
saw Cyril leading the Queen to a seat, and found that Princess Anna,
in the shadows beside him, was also a witness of the reconciliation.
The sight seemed to destroy her self-command altogether, for she fell
upon him as the nearest victim, and stormed at him in Thracian for
some minutes. Then, either because her anger had exhausted itself, or
because she was mollified by his enforced meekness under her attack,
she burst into tears, and was led away, sobbing bitterly, by Baroness
von Hilfenstein, who appeared opportunely from out of the gloom.
</p>

CHAPTER XVIII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE PENALTY OF GREATNESS.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">Well</span>, gentlemen!” said Mr Hicks, as Cyril, holding tightly to
Mansfield’s arm, stumbled painfully into the cave about sunset, “I’m
glad to see you, any way, for I had a notion that the gateway lady
might have fixed you both up with safer quarters than these, but I
guess the distinguished patient is about played-out?”
</p>

<p>
“Never felt better in my life!” returned Cyril, collapsing on his bed.
“Don’t plague me to-night, Hicks. I shall be as fit as possible after
a good rest.”
</p>

<p>
“No, sir. I think I see myself allowing you to die of starvation. Joy
may seem to answer every demand of a man’s nature, but it don’t serve
him instead of his regular meals. Come, you don’t incline to give her
Majesty the trouble of coming all this way down to see you again right
now, do you?”
</p>

<p>
“Then you were awake after all?” said Cyril, accepting meekly the bowl
of broth which Mr Hicks forced upon him. “I thought your sleep was
suspiciously profound.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, Count, I don’t mind allowing that I wasn’t as fast asleep as I
looked. But I was on my honour not to interfere with Mr Mansfield’s
plan of campaign, and I didn’t. For the rest, you may be sure that the
grave isn’t a circumstance to me in the matter of discreet silence.”
</p>

<p>
“I haven’t a doubt of it. Well, this soup of yours has waked me up
pretty thoroughly, so I may as well explain things a little to the two
of you, for I can see you are both palpitating with curiosity. It
seems that when the Queen was obliged to leave Thracia, she chose
Brutli as her place of refuge, for family reasons. The senior
deaconess was once betrothed to one of the Schwarzwald-Molzau princes,
but he died just when the family had given their consent to his
marrying her. The sisters received the Queen most kindly, but she
found that her steps were continually dogged by spies. The Princess of
Dardania was anxious to have it thought she was mad, and seems to have
left no means untried to make her so. It was partly this perpetual
espionage that made her refuse to admit any man to her presence, and
partly&mdash;well, that was my fault.”
</p>

<p>
“Very natural in the circumstances, Count.” Mr Hicks’s comment was
diplomatically ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
“Of course such seclusion only gave colour to her cousin’s inventions,
and the Queen and her ladies saw this. It was Mlle. Mirkovics who
devised a plan of relief. She was in Damascus when the Vali arrested
the Beni Ismail for non-payment of their tribute, and she told the
Queen about it. Her Majesty was so much affected and distressed that
Princess Anna, to please her, paid up the arrears of tribute through
the sheikh. After such kindness as that, he could not refuse to answer
the questions she asked him about the unknown desert in which his
tribe were said to live, and he even offered to guide her to this
place, Sitt Zeynab, thinking that all Europeans were interested in
antiquities. The tribe had kept it in some sort of repair as a
fortress for use in war-time, but they preferred sticking to their
tents in the oasis whenever they could. It seems to have struck her
that this might afford the Queen the refuge of which she felt the
need, and when the sheikh came to her in his next trouble she made a
bargain with him. The Queen induced the Empress of Pannonia to use her
influence at Czarigrad, so saving the tribe from deportation, and they
accepted her as their ruler. They have really made rather a good thing
out of it, for they have been provided with food, and had their
tribute paid, on condition that they robbed no more caravans. Of
course the Vali and Mahmud Fadil know the truth about the mysterious
Princess, but they have accepted a present to hold their tongues, and
they are honourable men.”
</p>

<p>
“But General Banics and M. Stefanovics&mdash;don’t they know?” cried
Mansfield. “To keep them there at Brutli eating their hearts out&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“The Queen told me herself that she had entreated them to return to
Thracia, but they refused to go. No, they do not know. It was
impossible to confide the secret to them, for the Princess of
Dardania’s emissaries are buzzing round them continually. Naturally
Madame Stefanovics knows the truth, for she spends part of every day
at the Institute, with the lady who is left there to delude the
Queen’s visitors. Mlle. Mirkovics and Fräulein von Staubach spend
alternate months here and at Brutli, and do their best to account for
the fortnight which must pass before the Queen can be seen, or can
give an answer to any question.”
</p>

<p>
“Guess it’s a queer life here for a set of lone women,” remarked Mr
Hicks.
</p>

<p>
“The Queen seems to have found it rather peaceful than otherwise. They
have plenty of servants&mdash;fugitive Armenians who were glad to find a
refuge here with their wives and children&mdash;and the Arabs are
wonderfully amenable. They have lost their old occupation of highway
robbery, but they find it rather interesting, for a change, to mislead
inquisitive travellers, and they appear to be taking kindly to the
cultivation of their oasis. The Queen is much too devoted to the tribe
to take leave of them altogether, but I think they will be able to get
on with an occasional visit.”
</p>

<p>
“When her Majesty and you are reigning at Jerusalem?” There was a
touch of awe in Mr Hicks’s voice. “Well, Count, I have always reckoned
you the most almighty successful man of my acquaintance&mdash;with runs of
bad luck now and then, of course, like the rest of us&mdash;but you bet I
never thought of anything like this. You start right away into the
desert on the maddest freak in creation, and it brings you out just
where you calculated to be, and fixes you up with the finest future a
man could desire. But then you started with getting round the twelve
tribes of Israel, and the man that can do that has little to learn,
even with regard to the female persuasion.”
</p>

<p>
“You see, once I had the clue, the whole mystery surrounding the Queen
of the Desert vanished away,” said Cyril. “It is rather hard on Mlle.
Mirkovics, for I am convinced that one of her reasons for bringing the
Queen here was the desire to remove her beyond the reach of my baleful
influence, but that is the way things happen in this world. By the
bye, the Queen would like me to present you both to her to-morrow, so
be prepared.”
</p>

<p>
“Count,” said Mr Hicks warningly, “I’m a plain American citizen, whose
intercourse with kings and queens and courts has been strictly
professional. Do you ask me to compromise my independence right now by
figuring round as a member of your suite?”
</p>

<p>
“No, I don’t,” said Cyril, while Mansfield laughed, remembering the
Baroness’s description of himself; “I want to introduce you both, as
my friends, to the lady who is going to do me the honour of marrying
me. She knows that I owe my life to you both several times over, and
that I couldn’t have got here without you.”
</p>

<p>
“Shake, Count!” said Mr Hicks; “you’re a white man, sir. And if it
would make you any happier, you may bet your last red cent I would go
so far as to put on a Court suit for the occasion, if you had one here
and offered it me.”
</p>

<p>
With this magnanimous surrender on Mr Hicks’s part, the conversation
ended, and on the morrow it appeared that he was highly dissatisfied
with the meagreness of the preparation it was possible to make for his
visit to the Queen. His travel-worn clothes and the helmet in which he
had ridden out of Damascus were the objects of much anxious care, and
he went so far as to offer to part with his cherished beard, if Cyril
thought well, but the sacrifice was gratefully declined. Little time
was allowed for personal decoration, since the prisoners had scarcely
finished breakfast when the sheikh made his appearance, his demeanour
betokening a vast increase of respect, to the extent even of sending a
messenger in advance, to ask whether the Prince of the Jews would
receive him. On entering, he bowed to the ground before Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“O my lord, the Princess desires thee and thy servants to come to her.
‘Where are my friends?’ she says. ‘Bring them here, that I may make
with them the treaty that they desire.’ O my lord, how is this? It has
never been the pleasure of the Princess heretofore that any stranger
should approach her.”
</p>

<p>
“What did I tell you?” asked Cyril, through Mr Hicks. “Didn’t I say
that the Princess would receive me and enter into a treaty?”
</p>

<p>
“O my lord, thy words sounded in the ears of thy servant as
foolishness, but they have indeed proved true. My lord will speak
favourably of his servant before the Princess?”
</p>

<p>
“By all means,” said Cyril pleasantly, as the sheikh drew back to
allow him to pass out of the cave. Once outside, the whole party
mounted their horses, and rode up the hill-path in state, escorted by
the tribesmen, who discharged their guns at intervals to do honour to
the mighty stranger. Arrived at the gate, where the Armenian servants
were drawn up in line to receive the visitors, the sheikh alone
entered with his guests. Just as the gate was closing, Mansfield
uttered an exclamation.
</p>

<p>
“There are two men on camels riding across the desert from the
direction of Damascus!” he cried. “They are kicking up a tremendous
cloud of dust, so they must be coming fast.”
</p>

<p>
“It is doubtless a post bringing letters for the Princess,” said the
sheikh; “but I know not why there should be two men. See, the watchman
has observed them,” as a shot rang out from the lofty tower on the
wall. “Word will be brought at once if there is any ill news.”
</p>

<p>
They passed on through the portico into the great hall, and paused
before the doorway of a room opening from it on the left. A servant
drew aside the curtain, and revealed Queen Ernestine enthroned upon a
marble seat, with Baroness von Hilfenstein and Mlle. Mirkovics
standing behind her. All three ladies were swathed from head to foot
in white <i>isars</i>, but the sheikh prostrated himself without venturing
to steal a glance at them, and remained with his forehead touching the
ground.
</p>

<p>
“Behold, O great Princess, the Prince of the Jews,” he said. “He is
come to learn thy will concerning his nation.”
</p>

<p>
“It is well,” said the Queen, through Princess Anna. “My scribe shall
declare to him my pleasure, and do thou wait without to conduct him
back to his lodging when the audience is over.”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh retired, quitting the awful presence of his sovereign with
unconcealed willingness, and when he was safely out of sight the
ladies relieved the Queen of her veil. After a word or two with Cyril,
she turned to Mr Hicks and Mansfield with a smile that won their
hearts for ever.
</p>

<p>
“Count Mortimer’s friends are mine,” she said, stepping forward and
holding out a hand to each; “and he has told me what good friends you
have been to him. Please do not think I shall be jealous of his
affection for you. I know that I owe this meeting to your fidelity to
him.”
</p>

<p>
To Cyril’s intense delight, that sturdy republican, Mr Hicks, dropped
on one knee to kiss the Queen’s hand, as though to the manner born,
murmuring:
</p>

<p>
“If I were Count Mortimer’s deadliest enemy, madame, I guess the
inducement you offer would make me friends with him right away.”
</p>

<p>
“I know your story,” said the Queen softly to Mansfield, as he kissed
her hand in silence, unable to utter a word. “Consider me your friend,
and let me assure you that Count Mortimer is also on your side. When
one is happy oneself, one is always eager to make others so.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril smiled involuntarily, as he wondered in what light the Queen
would regard Mansfield’s love-story when she heard of her son’s
admiration for Philippa, and there was the faintest ghost of a bitter
laugh from Mlle. Mirkovics. A pained look crossed the Queen’s face,
but before she could speak, the sheikh’s voice was heard on the other
side of the curtain, very close to the ground.
</p>

<p>
“Let the Princess pardon the presumption of her servant, but word is
come for the Prince of the Jews, entreating him to return immediately
to Es Sham. The messenger has travelled day and night.”
</p>

<p>
Mlle. Mirkovics interpreted the words, and the Queen’s eyes filled
with tears as they met Cyril’s. He had made an involuntary movement
towards the door, but her gaze of entreaty drew him back.
</p>

<p>
“I am at your commands, madame,” he said, with forced calmness.
</p>

<p>
“If I ask you, you will stay?” she said, too low for the rest to hear,
and her eyes marked, almost with agony, the struggle in his face.
</p>

<p>
“I will stay, Ernestine&mdash;if you ask me,” he replied at last. He spoke
without enthusiasm, but with the desperate resolution to atone by one
tremendous sacrifice for his past sins against her.
</p>

<p>
“But I don’t ask you. You must go&mdash;at once, if it is necessary. But
come to me before you start, and tell me what has happened.
Messieurs,” she turned again to Mr Hicks and Mansfield, “I regret to
have had so little conversation with you. We must meet again&mdash;at
Brutli, I hope. There is much that I wish to ask you.”
</p>

<p>
Again the gleam of that dazzling smile, for which, as Mr Hicks
confided afterwards to Mansfield, he would have walked round the
world, and the visitors retired. The moment they were gone, the Queen
turned to Anna Mirkovics.
</p>

<p>
“Anna, you have disappointed me&mdash;grieved me bitterly. You will not
forget!”
</p>

<p>
“How can I forget, madame? He leaves you now&mdash;even now&mdash;in a moment,
for his policy.”
</p>

<p>
“I told him to go. He would have stayed. Why will you not consent to
be happy, since I am? It breaks my heart to see how you hate him.”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, I do rejoice to see you happy. There is nothing I desire more
on earth. But I cannot forget. In my eyes, your happiness has no
foundation. My blood boils when I remember how he treated you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Anna, Anna, think. I love him. Can’t you understand? Don’t you know
what love is?”
</p>

<p>
“Alas, madame, yes! I love you.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you do understand. You have borne with me, my despair, my
fretfulness, my ill temper, because you love me. Your love has never
failed for one moment. And that is the measure of my love for him.”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, I will not have you compare yourself with him. I love your
changes of mood&mdash;even your coldness. How can they make any difference
to me?”
</p>

<p>
“And I love him in the same way. Come, Anna, you would not make me
miserable? How can I be happy if you persist in frowning upon my
happiness?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you break my heart, madame! Well, then, I rejoice that you are
happy, and if his Excellency continues to make you so, I shall rejoice
all my life long that he has returned to you.”
</p>

<p>
“That is my dear good Anna!” cried the Queen, drawing her friend’s
pale plain face down to hers, and kissing her on the forehead.
“Hilfenstein, I must kiss you too, for you have been on my side the
whole time.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, madame, I have known you a good many years, and the Count also,”
said the Baroness. “It would have been little use my opposing either
of you. But I hear his Excellency returning. Your Majesty will receive
him alone?”
</p>

<p>
The Queen’s smile was a sufficient answer to the question, and both
ladies disappeared hastily into the garden as Cyril entered from the
hall, looking rather irritated than perturbed.
</p>

<p>
“Dearest,” he said, “I think you understand that nothing but the very
gravest necessity would drag me away from you at this moment, but I
really must go. The blind man Yeshua has come all the way from
Damascus to say that Paschics entreats me to return at once, if all
that we have gained is not to be lost. Evidently something serious has
happened, which I did not foresee, and which has thrown out all our
calculations. Moreover, as far as I can make out, there was an
unmistakable attempt made to kidnap Yeshua on his way to the spot
where he always arranges to meet your scouts, and he insists that the
Scythian Consulate was mixed up in it. However that may be, it seems
that the Beni Ayub are out on the warpath as well, for they chased
Yeshua and your tribesman who was bringing him here. They only shook
them off when they got to the waterless desert. It may be a mere
coincidence, but it looks uncommonly like an organised attempt to
prevent any notice of the danger, whatever it may be, from reaching
me. At any rate, it’s clear that I must go, or give up all hope of
success in the great scheme.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, I quite see,” she replied quickly, “and I shall come back
to Brutli at once. Then our engagement shall be made public, Cyril.
You are going back to win success for me as well as for yourself, you
know.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know that every one will say I have sought your forgiveness
for the sake of the added importance that marriage with you will give
me? The world hasn’t very much confidence in me, Ernestine.”
</p>

<p>
“But I have. Do you know what I shall do when you are Prince of
Palestine? I shall lay aside my crown for a coronet. The world shall
see that your wife is prouder of being Princess of Palestine than
Queen of Thracia.”
</p>

<p>
“My dearest, you have a way of making the world look foolish by doing
lofty, Quixotic, useless things, that covers me with shame. I wish I
had the knack, but no one would believe that I did them without an
ulterior motive. But suppose I am not made Prince of Palestine?”
</p>

<p>
“Then we will return here together, and you shall be King of the
Desert. You will unite the Arabs under one rule, and make a nation of
them, and they will adore you. They are grateful to me because of what
I have done for them, but they still feel a little ashamed of being
ruled by a woman. They have the greatest possible respect for you
already.”
</p>

<p>
“Will they still respect me when I rob them of their Queen? One, or at
most two visits in the year, as a respite from the cares of State,
will be very different from having a resident sovereign. But dearest,
you won’t start for Brutli until the sheikh assures you that the way
is safe? If the Beni Ayub got hold of you it would be very unpleasant
personally, and absolutely distracting politically.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I suppose Michael would feel obliged to interfere. Oh, Cyril, I
wanted to speak to you about him. You heard of that terribly sad
business about Lida, of course? Well, since his engagement came to an
end, Michael has written me such nice letters, so affectionate, so
respectful. He says that he has turned over a new leaf, and this is
because he has formed an attachment for a young lady who will be as
acceptable to me as to Thracia. Do you know who she is?”
</p>

<p>
“I have an idea.”
</p>

<p>
“And is it all as suitable as he thinks?”
</p>

<p>
“So far as I know, the only opposition to their engagement will come
from the lady herself.”
</p>

<p>
“But why? Is she as beautiful and altogether desirable as he says she
is?”
</p>

<p>
“I feel some delicacy in answering that question. You see, she happens
to be my niece.”
</p>

<p>
“What! your brother Carlino’s daughter? But, Cyril, the Thracians will
go mad with joy. Is it the little girl with the beautiful golden hair
whom I saw years ago at Tatarjé? She must be a good deal older than
Michael, but she had such sweet ways that it is no wonder she has
captivated him. He could not make a better choice. But why are you
looking at me in that way, Cyril? Why should she raise any objection?
It’s not&mdash;oh, don’t say that you have no other niece! This is not the
young lady with whom that pleasant Mr Mansfield is in love?”
</p>

<p>
“Unfortunately it is.”
</p>

<p>
“But she couldn’t refuse Michael!”
</p>

<p>
“And yet I heard a lady propose a few minutes ago to resign a crown
for the sake of her lover.”
</p>

<p>
“But that is different. Your niece would be the making of Michael.
Cyril, promise me you will persuade her to accept him.”
</p>

<p>
“My dearest, I could not set myself a second time to interfere with
the course of true love.”
</p>

<p>
“But she ought&mdash;oh, Cyril, how unkind of you to remind me of that! No,
most certainly I won’t try to smooth Michael’s path for him. I did too
much harm the last time, and it has come to nothing after all. But you
do think it is her duty to marry him, don’t you?”
</p>

<p>
“I fancy Phil will decide for herself where her duty lies. And really,
Ernestine, it will do your boy all the good in the world to want
something very much, and not be able to get it. That will make a man
of him, if you like. Is that some one outside?”
</p>

<p>
“I beg your pardon, Count”&mdash;Mansfield’s deprecating voice was heard
from the hall&mdash;“but the horses are ready.”
</p>

<p>
“Those two good fellows have been doing my packing, that I might have
a longer time with you. Good-bye, my dearest. <i>Au revoir</i> at Brutli!”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>, my beloved! Take care of yourself for my sake.”
</p>

<p>
“By the bye, dearest, I suppose I may assure your sheikh that it’s all
right about the treaty, and that you have decided to maintain friendly
relations with the Jews?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course you may. But politics again, Cyril! I am jealous.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The sheikh and a small band of picked men were in readiness in the
desert below the fortress, all well armed, and mounted on the best
horses that the tribe possessed. Yeshua and his guide were to be left
behind, to give them time to recover from the fatigues of their
hurried journey before undertaking another, for the sheikh had
promised to conduct the travellers to Damascus by the shortest
available route, involving as few halts as possible, and the hardship
would be great. In spite, however, of long stages and little rest,
with a meagre supply of food and water, the return from Sitt Zeynab
proved much less disagreeable than the journey thither had been. The
sheikh had banished from his mind the last traces of suspicion and
enmity, and was above all things anxious to secure Cyril’s friendship
for his tribe, and for his tribe alone. His anxiety lest the Prince of
the Jews should admit the Beni Ayub also to a share in his favour
found utterance again and again, and was as amusing as was his claim
to the entire ownership of the desert between Damascus and Palmyra. He
went so far as to invite Cyril to aid him in maintaining his supposed
rights by force of arms, but this was merely a rhetorical flourish,
not intended to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the journey, including the crossing of the waterless
desert which was the true patrimony of the Beni Ismail, was
uneventful, but no sooner had the boundary, invisible as it was to the
untrained eye, been crossed, than the party became aware that they
were watched. A camel and its rider would suddenly appear on the
horizon, only to vanish in a cloud of dust as quickly as they had
come. Sometimes these scouts would appear in the direction of
Damascus, sometimes to the right or left of the line of march, but for
two days they kept the travellers almost constantly in sight, without
offering to approach them more closely.
</p>

<p>
“The sons of Shaitan can see us much more readily than we can see
them,” grumbled the sheikh, “and they are closing round us. Then they
will lie in wait for us in the broken ground before reaching Es Sham.”
</p>

<p>
“How would you shake them off if we were not here?” asked Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“We would lead them astray, O my lord, with feigned pursuit of their
scouts, and running fights, until we were either safe on our own land
or could slip through them into Es Sham, but that would need many
days, and if they contrived to separate us one from another, evil
might come to my lord.”
</p>

<p>
“Evil might also come to some of them,” suggested Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“Doubtless, but if their object is rather to delay my lord than to
hurt him, they might attain it with little danger to themselves.”
</p>

<p>
“Hullo! they seem to be coming to meet us,” said Mansfield, as a group
of mounted men appeared from behind a sandhill some distance in front.
The sheikh cast his eye over his own troop, and ordered a halt. Here
on the open plain there was no possibility of an ambush, but his men
unslung their long matchlocks, and the travellers locked to their
rifles.
</p>

<p>
“They seem friendly,” said Cyril, as the sheikh of the opposite party,
distinguished by his gold-embroidered crimson cloak, rode out from
among his men, making signs that he had left his weapons behind, and
desired an amicable conference.
</p>

<p>
“Stay thou here, O Prince of the Jews,” said the sheikh, “and let the
father of a writing-book leave his gun and ride forward with me, that
we may hear what this dog has to say. Never yet have I spoken in peace
with a man of the Beni Ayub.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks, who owed his name to the note-book which was his inseparable
companion, handed his rifle to Mansfield, remarking that he supposed
the surrender of his revolver was not necessarily included in the
bond. If it was, he had, at any rate, a weapon at hand which would
astonish the Arab who tried any foolishness with him, and as he spoke
he patted a coil of thin rope which he had procured at Sitt Zeynab and
insisted on looping to his saddle, to the mystification of his
companions. Thus provided, he rode forward with the sheikh, who halted
at a discreet distance from the representative of the other party, and
asked what the Beni Ayub were doing in that portion of the desert. As
the district in question was claimed by the Beni Ayub, their sheikh
disregarded the enquiry.
</p>

<p>
“We come in peace, O sheikh of the Beni Ismail, hearing that the
Prince of the Jews is a sojourner in the tents of thy people. Why does
he pass by the Beni Ayub in his return to Es Sham? Does not the desert
belong to us also? Let him turn aside and visit our tents, that we may
make peace with his nation, and there be no ill blood between us.”
</p>

<p>
“The Prince of the Jews will return at another time and visit you,”
said Mr Hicks, anticipating the angry reply which the sheikh had in
preparation. “At present he is journeying to Es Sham in haste.”
</p>

<p>
“What is his haste to us?” was the retort. “Shall we allow the Beni
Ismail, who obey a woman, to laugh at our beards because the Prince of
the Jews has sojourned among them? Let the Prince visit our tents, or
we will come and take him.”
</p>

<p>
“But where are your tents?” asked Mr Hicks, “and have you a sufficient
number of horsemen to give fitting escort to the Prince?”
</p>

<p>
“My tents lie a day’s journey on the way to Es Sham, and as thou
seest, I have with me three times the number of horsemen that ride now
with the Prince.”
</p>

<p>
“Altogether you make out a good case for yourself,” said Mr Hicks,
easily. “Suppose you and your men ride ahead and get ready for us?”
</p>

<p>
“Nay, we desire to show due honour to the Prince. My company shall
ride side by side with his to the tents of my people.”
</p>

<p>
“Very good. But the Prince will have none but his own followers around
him.”
</p>

<p>
“It is well. We will but be at hand, for the safety of the Prince.”
</p>

CHAPTER XIX.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE BREAKING-POINT.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">Returning</span> to his friends in company with the amazed and indignant
sheikh of their own party Mr Hicks explained how matters stood,
pointing out that discretion was preeminently the better part of
valour on this occasion.
</p>

<p>
“The enemy are between us and Damascus, and they don’t calculate to
let us through,” he said. “I guess the odds are a bit too long for
fighting, so all we can do is to select our camping-ground with an eye
to possibilities, and make tracks in the night, for if they once get
us to their tents we’re as good as squelched. With your leave, Count,
I’ll ride slightly ahead, to keep open communications with the other
platform, and also to look out for a suitable location.”
</p>

<p>
Leaving the scouts, who had now come in, to bring up the rear of the
convoy, the sheikh of the Beni Ayub and the main body of his men took
up their position in advance of the small party from Sitt Zeynab, and
Mr Hicks attached himself to them, doing his best to impress the
sheikh with the greatness of the Prince of the Jews. It was evident
that the man was already somewhat alarmed by his own temerity in
interfering with the journey of such an important personage, and Mr
Hicks spared no pains to add to his uneasiness. When sunset was at
hand, and the sheikh suggested that it would be advisable to halt for
the night, he was told curtly that the Prince had not yet given the
signal, and when the Prince, through his representative, Mr Hicks, was
pleased to direct that the journey should be at an end for the day,
the spot chosen was not by any means an ideal camping-ground in the
eyes of the Beni Ayub. It was a small hill&mdash;perhaps a large hillock
would be a better term&mdash;accessible on one side only, and not affording
space for more than Cyril and his party.
</p>

<p>
“I only hope they’ll conclude to camp all round it,” said Mr Hicks to
his leader, “for then they would be so scattered that we might allow
to creep through them, or charge right through at the weakest point,
any way. If we could stampede the horses we could get clean away, more
especially since we shall have our own men in a compact body.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Hicks’s hope proved fallacious. Making the best of a bad bargain,
the sheikh decided to concentrate his forces at the foot of the slope,
thus enclosing his unwilling guests in a trap, and his men set to work
at once on their preparations for the night.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Mr Hicks grimly, “it only means that we’ve got to land
the horses some way in that cañon back of us, and without making any
noise about it, either. Mr Mansfield, you just set your mighty
intellect to work on that problem, if you please. Now, how are we to
get these chaps to believe that we allow to sit up all night?”
</p>

<p>
“Make a fire of brushwood and keep it burning,” suggested Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“I guess the light will just about give us away if we do.”
</p>

<p>
“Make two or three small fires across the slope,” said Cyril, “as if
to prevent the Arabs rushing us, and keep them low and smoky by
heaping on earth as well as wood. That ought to produce the desired
moral effect.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s so, sir. Well, Mr Mansfield, have you figured out anything to
help us at the back there?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m going to explore as soon as the enemy have settled down to their
supper,” answered Mansfield, and as the result of his explorations he
was able before long to announce that there existed on the steepest
side of the hill an apology for a path, almost invisible to the naked
eye, down which it ought to be possible to lead the horses.
</p>

<p>
“A sweet path it must be, if our friends the enemy haven’t sniffed it
out!” grumbled Mr Hicks; “and what a real elegant set of fools we
shall look when all the horses go down ker-smash one on top of
another! And what about the noise, Mr Mansfield? If you ask me, I
should say there would be a good deal of promiscuous language flying
around while that descent is taking place.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense, Hicks! these Arabs can control their emotions better than
that,” said Cyril. “If the horses’ feet are muffled, that’s the only
thing necessary.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, we can’t do more than try,” said Mr Hicks resignedly. “But all
the same,” he added to Mansfield, “you bet I wouldn’t do that but for
the boss. He is chafing fit to burst, and if we got carried off to the
tents of the Beni Ayub, I wouldn’t answer for him. And now for our
sheikh.”
</p>

<p>
The sheikh approved highly of Cyril’s determination to outwit the
enemy, although he had little confidence in the success of the means
suggested, and in order to avert suspicion the camp on the hill-top
made ostentatious preparations for repose. Three men were told off to
move about round the fires and keep them supplied with fuel and sand,
and the rest wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down. As soon
as all was quiet in the camp of the Beni Ayub below, one man at a time
rose and crept softly to the spot where the horses were picketed. The
sheikh insisted on being the first to try the path, as his horse had
been trained to follow him like a dog, and to Mansfield’s intense
relief and secret pride the animal, its feet muffled in pieces of
cloth, picked its way down the hill after its master, reluctantly but
without accident. The rest followed one by one, with more or less
willingness, the men at the fires covering the occasional noises,
which were unavoidable in the case of a stumble, or when a stone was
set rolling, by a vigorous breaking of sticks, which sounded so
distinct in the clear desert air that Mr Hicks muttered it was enough
to wake all the Arabs for miles round. Then the men at the fires were
called down in their turn, the last to descend exhibiting marvellous
activity in producing dense clouds of smoke before he departed, and
the whole of the Sitt Zeynab party stood safely in the desert with
their horses. Mounting, they felt their way with extreme caution round
the flank of the Beni Ayub, and resumed their interrupted journey,
taking a direction that would enable them to reach Damascus without
coming upon the camp to which their enemies had intended to conduct
them. They had ridden some distance before any one had leisure to look
round, and it was Mr Hicks who perceived first that the forsaken
hill-top was no longer deserted, and uttered an exclamation. The eyes
of the rest followed his, to distinguish a number of figures outlined
against the red glow of the fires, which had by this time burnt up.
</p>

<p>
“That I should have been sold by a nigger chief!” groaned Mr Hicks.
“All the time we were busy circumventing them, they were calculating
to circumvent us, and all that old sinner’s respect and veneration was
only a cute dodge to put us off our guard. As soon as they guessed our
stokers had sneaked off to bed, up they come to rush our camp. Well,
that gentleman and I have got to meet again, and you bet he’ll be
surprised at the strength of my attachment for him,” and again Mr
Hicks patted the rope which hung from his saddle.
</p>

<p>
“The sons of Shaitan thought to laugh at our beards,” said the skeikh,
with a grim sound dimly suggestive of a chuckle; “but now their own
faces are black. They will not pursue us until dawn, and we may even
yet out-distance them.”
</p>

<p>
But in making this forecast the sheikh forgot that the enemy’s horses,
which had done little work the day before, were far fresher than those
of his party; and it was less than an hour after sunrise when one of
his men, halting a moment to repair a broken girth, called out that
the pursuers were in sight. Cyril uttered an angry exclamation.
</p>

<p>
“Look here, Hicks,” he said impatiently, “I can’t stand any more of
this foolery. I don’t want bloodshed; but if these fellows will have
it, they must. Our sheikh and two of his men have rifles, and with our
three we can diminish the enemy’s numbers effectually before they get
close to us, and then the revolver will settle the matter. I can’t
risk losing everything merely to save the skins of the Beni Ayub.”
</p>

<p>
“Gently, Count. If you once set up a blood-feud with the Beni Ayub,
your chance of making friends with them in future is gone. I guess
we’ll keep on as hard as possible right now, so as just to separate
the enemy. When we get to the locality I have in my mind, Mr Mansfield
and I and the two men with rifles will stay behind and go on the
shoot, while you ride ahead with the sheikh and the rest and draw the
enemy into chasing you.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you think it likely,” irritably, “that I shall consent to save
myself at the risk of your lives? We shall come out of this fight side
by side, as we went in, or go down together.”
</p>

<p>
“Now, now, Count”&mdash;Mr Hicks laid a soothing hand on Cyril’s arm&mdash;“we
aren’t going to hurl our lives away, you bet. There’s no sort of
sentimental self-sacrifice about me&mdash;no, sir! I have a smart piece of
business on hand, and I want a young fellow of large bodily strength
to help me put it through. You are just a bundle of nerves this
journey, and so used up with strain and anxiety that it’s only spirit
and nothing else keeps you on your horse. Mr Mansfield and I are
partners in this deal, and you watch how well things will pan out when
they recognise who’s got ’em in charge.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril laughed shamefacedly, and turned his attention to keeping his
horse in hand in the headlong race which now ensued. Mr Hicks’s object
was to escape from the flat stretch of desert on which the enemy, with
their fresher horses, might easily surround his little party, and to
gain the shelter of the sandhills in front. Pausing to look back, he
observed with satisfaction that the Beni Ayub, no longer massed in a
compact body, were tailing off gradually, the sheikh and a few
better-mounted men alone seeming to gain perceptibly on the pursued.
When the sandhills were reached, he glanced back once more, and saw
that the sheikh, on his magnificent horse, was now considerably in
advance of his nearest followers. This was what Mr Hicks had hoped
for.
</p>

<p>
“Ride on, Count! ride on, sheikh! Turn aside, Mr Mansfield, and you
two, Abd-el-Kader and Nur-ed-Din. Dodge behind the sandhills, so. Have
your rifles ready.”
</p>

<p>
Shouting in alternate English and Arabic, and strengthening his
exhortations by means of vigorous pointing and shoving, Mr Hicks
marshalled his forces. He and Mansfield were stationed close to the
path between the sandhills, one on each side, the two Arabs a little
behind them.
</p>

<p>
“Stay where you are, Mr Mansfield; and when you see the sheikh
dismounted, round up his horse. That’s your business. You two men of
the Beni Ismail, ride forward the moment the sheikh of your enemies
has passed you and present your rifles at those who come after him. If
they still ride on, fire; but don’t waste your shots, and reserve the
second barrel.”
</p>

<p>
Having given his orders, Mr Hicks rode back a short distance from the
path, and, unhooking the rope from his saddle, arranged it on his arm.
This was scarcely accomplished to his satisfaction before Mansfield’s
raised hand told him that the sheikh was close upon them, thundering
on in hot pursuit of the party that was just disappearing round the
sandhills in front. Neither Mansfield nor the Arabs could ever succeed
in saying definitely what followed. That Mr Hicks rode forward across
the sheikh’s path, that the rope in his hand whizzed through the air,
and that in an instant the sheikh was prostrate on the ground and his
horse rushing wildly away&mdash;this they perceived, but had no time even
to wonder how it was done, for their own duties demanded their
attention. Mansfield effected the capture of the terrified horse in a
brilliant and wholly original manner; for when he grabbed frantically
at its bridle as it dashed towards him, and failed to seize it, he
kicked his foot free of the stirrup and caught it in the loose rein,
with the result that he was promptly jerked from his saddle and thrown
to the ground. Recovering himself immediately, he was in time to seize
the rein with his hand before the astonished horse had made up its
mind what to do. His own horse, which was equally amazed and
indignant, by reason of his unconventional descent, allowed itself to
be caught with less difficulty, and he turned to see how the other
actors in the drama were faring. The two Arabs were sitting
statue-like on their horses, covering with their rifles five or six of
the Beni Ayub, who, on seeing their chief fall, had halted just out of
range, and were afraid to follow him further, while the sheikh
himself, black in the face and half-strangled, was being bound hand
and foot in a most workman-like manner by Mr Hicks.
</p>

<p>
“Well done!” cried Mansfield. “Who would ever have thought of a lasso
in this part of the world?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, I haven’t gone cowboying in New Mexico for nothing,” said Mr
Hicks complacently. “Go ahead, you fool! The more you kick, the
tighter the knots will be, you bet. Ah, Mr Mansfield, you inclined to
think I brought this lariat along to fix up my prisoners with before
they were caught, but you see it has caught ’em and tied ’em both. Now
I’m through, I guess I’ll mount this gentleman’s horse&mdash;for these
Arabs are so cute that it would make nothing of carrying him right
back to his friends all on its own hook, according to the
Sunday-school books&mdash;and he shall have a seat on mine. But wait a
minute first.”
</p>

<p>
He dragged his prisoner to a spot where he was in full view of his
dismayed followers, and drawing out his revolver, held it to his head.
</p>

<p>
“You see this, men of the Beni Ayub?” he cried in Arabic, accompanying
the words with appropriate gestures. “Your sheikh will go with us the
rest of our journey. If you attack us, the first shot we fire will
settle his business, and if you even molest us, we will take him to Es
Sham and deliver him to the Roumis there. Therefore beware!”
</p>

<p>
Having shouted his warning, Mr Hicks mounted the sheikh’s horse, and
with Mansfield’s assistance bound the prisoner firmly on his own;
then, with the two Arabs bringing up the rear, they rode on after the
rest. Great was the joy and exultation with which the Beni Ismail
beheld the unpleasant plight of their hereditary foe; but Cyril
interposed to forbid any indignities being offered to the captive, who
might yet serve as a useful intermediary with his tribe. The novel
method of his capture had produced a strong effect upon his mind, and
largely increased his respect for the Prince of the Jews, and this
feeling was enhanced by the continued failure of his own tribesmen to
rescue him. They followed the party at a distance, and prowled round
the camp at night in the hope of taking its defenders by surprise; but
Mr Hicks and Mansfield kept watch and watch all night through, and
this unceasing vigilance had its reward. By dint of long marches and
little rest, the desert was safely crossed in six days after leaving
Sitt Zeynab, and within three hours’ ride of Damascus the cavalcade
paused while Cyril gave orders for the prisoner to be unbound, and his
horse and rifle restored to him.
</p>

<p>
“Return to thy tribe, O Sheikh of the Beni Ayub,” he said, “and tell
them of the clemency of the Prince of the Jews. I might have carried
thee bound into Es Sham, and left thee to rot in a Roumi dungeon, but
I send thee back to thy people, that they may know that I desire to be
their friend, and that it is my will there shall be peace throughout
the desert.”
</p>

<p>
The bewildered sheikh listened apathetically as Mr Hicks translated
the words, but when the Beni Ismail drew aside to allow him to pass,
he seemed to recognise all at once that he was free, and setting spurs
to his horse, darted off into the desert like the wind. As his late
custodians stood watching him, he reined up when almost out of sight,
and returned.
</p>

<p>
“O Prince of the Jews, the Beni Ayub are thy servants,” he cried.
“Never would I have laid wait for thee but for the words of the old
man who came to our tents with the servant of the Consulate of
Scythia, and tempted thy servant with great gifts to detain thee in
the desert for a space. Now that I know thy power and thy wisdom,
never again will I or the Beni Ayub raise a spear against thee or thy
servants the Beni Ismail.”
</p>

<p>
Dismounting, he raised the hem of Cyril’s cloak to his lips, exchanged
greetings with the sheikh of the Beni Ismail, and rode away again.
</p>

<p>
“All’s well that ends well,” said Cyril. “And now for Damascus!”
</p>

<p>
They rode on briskly, only to halt again an hour later. This time it
was to bid farewell to the Beni Ismail, who in their enthusiasm for
their new leader had accompanied him far beyond their usual limits,
although for some time they had been looking askance at every hillock,
lest it should conceal that abomination of the desert Arab, a house.
The sheikh received Cyril’s messages for the Queen&mdash;including another
earnest recommendation not to cross the desert until the Beni Ayub had
returned to their usual haunts&mdash;his men salaamed, with frank
admiration beaming in their bold eyes, and stood gazing lingeringly as
Cyril and his two companions rode away. There were no more halts now,
and as the cultivated land was reached, the roads became better. The
unpleasant passage through the burying-ground was accomplished at a
reckless pace, and a judicious <i>bakhshish</i> prevented awkward inquiries
at the city gate. Riding more cautiously through the crowded streets,
the three adventurers, worn out with hard travelling and want of
sleep, drew rein at the door of the house which they had left just
three weeks before. Paschics rushed into the courtyard to meet them,
with bloodshot eyes and the dishevelled aspect of a man who has slept
for several nights in his clothes, and wept tears of joy when he saw
Cyril.
</p>

<p>
“Your Excellency is come. Then all is not lost!” he gasped.
</p>

<p>
“Well, what is it?” asked Cyril, dismounting.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Excellency, it is partly my fault, and yet how could I have
prevented it? It was that elderly official of the Princess of
Dardania’s&mdash;Colonel Czartoriski. The first two or three days after you
started he was continually sending letters and desiring to see you,
though I assured him you could receive no one. Then he disguised
himself with a false beard and green spectacles&mdash;yes, Excellency!&mdash;and
told the people of the house that he was a doctor for whom you had
sent, and they showed him which were your rooms. He did not approach
by the staircase, knowing that I should be on the watch, and Dietrich
also, but came up the steps leading from the garden, and crept along
the verandah, and so peeped in at the window of your room. Dietrich
caught sight of him first, and rushed out. Hearing a scuffle, I
followed, and penetrated the man’s disguise immediately. We delivered
him over to the police, after handling him not too gently, but the
Scythian Consul came to his assistance, and got him released at once.”
</p>

<p>
“But what has all this led to?” demanded Cyril, who had been listening
with what patience he might as the Thracian poured out his tale while
they were crossing the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
“Why, Excellency, your enemies had learnt that you were away, and they
took advantage of the news immediately. There is a recrudescence of
Anti-Semitism all over Europe, especially in Neustria. The great
Lutetian preacher is delivering a course of sermons against the Jews,
and the ‘Petite Parole’ opens its columns daily to correspondents
urging the most atrocious measures. All the other papers are following
suit, members of the Government have denounced the Palestine scheme in
the Chamber, and there are signs that the different political parties
are willing to meet on the common ground of hatred of the Jews.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, we know how to manage Neustria.”
</p>

<p>
“But that is not the worst, Excellency. M. Lucien Salomans is dead.”
</p>

<p>
“What, murdered?”
</p>

<p>
“They call it suicide. He was present at some public entertainment, at
which one of the performers made a violent attack on the Jews. He
remonstrated, and became involved in a heated discussion with several
gentlemen near him. It is alleged that he left the hall exclaiming
that, Jew though he was, it was in his power to destroy Neustria if he
chose&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Blatant fool!” cried Cyril furiously.
</p>

<p>
“Excellency, he is dead. He was arrested that evening, and his house
searched. In prison he was visited by two high officials, who spent
some time in his cell. This was late at night, and in the morning he
was discovered to be dead. They say that he shot himself to avoid
being surprised into disclosures, but it is whispered that one of his
visitors, enraged by his persistent silence, killed him with the
revolver which had been held to his head to extort a confession.”
</p>

<p>
“But surely he had not had the madness&mdash;&mdash; Did things end there?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, Excellency. Since his death the houses of the principal Jews
interested in our movement have been repeatedly subjected to sudden
visits from the police.”
</p>

<p>
“Good. They are baffled so far, then. And in other countries?”
</p>

<p>
“When the excitement began in Neustria, Excellency, the Continental
press in general reserved judgment, as though alarmed at the temerity
of the Lutetian papers. But when two or three days passed, and there
was no sign from you, they grew bold, and revived all their old
infamies, busying themselves also with the future of Palestine. It is
now recommended everywhere that Jerusalem shall be occupied by the
Powers jointly, and the Jews excluded from it. The Powers are also to
have charge of all the foreign relations of the new state, the Jews
regulating only such of its affairs as are purely national and
domestic. The alarm in the Jewish world is very great. The Chevalier
Goldberg has telegraphed again and again, asking for some assurance
that you have the situation in hand. He is afraid to take any steps
lest he should jeopardise some plan of yours, and I could not reassure
him, for you did not contemplate such a crisis as this in your
instructions.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I had not foreseen this,” said Cyril slowly. He had been
glancing, while Paschics spoke, through the piles of letters and
telegrams stacked on the table, flinging some aside and arranging
others carefully in order. He had a sheaf of papers in his hand now,
and was flicking them through absently.
</p>

<p>
“Sit down and write, Paschics,” was the sharp order which startled the
secretary. “And you, Mansfield&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Land alive, Count! you don’t allow to fix up all the affairs of
Europe before you get a bath and a sleep?” cried Mr Hicks, aghast.
</p>

<p>
“That’s exactly what I have to do. You take a rest, Hicks, if you
like.”
</p>

<p>
“Not much,” was the emphatic reply. “I won’t offer to write for you,
Count, since these two gentlemen know your ways better than I do. But
if you have any despatches to send off I can take them to the bureau
for you, and let daylight into any one that offers any objection. I
can operate the instrument if it’s necessary, you bet.”
</p>

<p>
“A hint at the nature of the hold we have over Neustria would make the
fortune of your paper if it got wind of it. But it must not, you
understand? If the responsibility is too great for you, I won’t burden
you with it.”
</p>

<p>
“I guess my conscience is asleep on the paper side just now, Count. Go
ahead, and make use of me right away.”
</p>

<p>
“The immediate business of the moment is to send an ultimatum to the
Neustrian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Unless this persecution&mdash;moral
and material&mdash;of the Jews ceases instantly, there will be presented to
the United States Government a memorandum of the secret convention
entered into between Scythia and Neustria with reference to the Darien
Canal. When American attention is distracted, owing to troubles
elsewhere, it is agreed that the two Powers shall take joint action
with regard to Darien.” Cyril looked sharply at Mr Hicks, who nodded
calmly.
</p>

<p>
“Good card, Count. It never struck me you had that up your sleeve.”
</p>

<p>
“You knew of the convention, then?”
</p>

<p>
“That is so, sir. I’m keeping it back for the next war-scare, or the
next time a war-scare is needed, any way. But you can just play it for
all it’s worth now. You see I know a Jew or two as well as you; but I
didn’t guess that you were able to put your fingers upon the missing
document.”
</p>

<p>
“Salomans and I were the only men who knew where it is concealed. Now
that he is dead, without revealing the secret to his brother, it will
have to be got at by means of a long chain of intermediaries. Each man
knows only his particular link in the chain; but we must be ready to
produce the paper at once if it is wanted.”
</p>

<p>
“And you don’t calculate that the Judenhetze has gone too far to be
stopped?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly not. They can stop it fast enough if they like. They will
have to take strong measures&mdash;possibly illegal measures&mdash;in the name
of the public safety, as they have done often enough when the result
would inflict injury upon the Jews. When Neustria is settled, we shall
have time to think of the rest of Europe. Ready, Paschics?”
</p>

<p>
Cyril laid down the telegrams, which he had been looking through as he
spoke, and glanced, with the faintest shadow of a smile, at Mansfield,
who was fast asleep, his head pillowed on his arms on the table. “Wake
up, Mansfield!” a firm hand gripped his shoulder. “You can rest
afterwards, but you must work now.”
</p>

<p>
For several hours Paschics wrote unceasingly, Mansfield laboured at
the typewriter, Mr Hicks hurried in and out with telegrams and their
answers, and still Cyril sat in his place, dictating to one, giving
directions to another, exchanging missives with the third. He seemed,
as Mr Hicks had said, to have the affairs of all Europe in his hands.
Reassuring messages went to one community of Jews, curt commands to
another, stern reproofs to yet another; while to high government
officials, and personages in situations even more lofty, were
despatched brief reminders of the unpleasant consequences that would
follow a breach of faith with the United Nation Syndicate. From the
Hercynian Chancellor to the editor of an obscure Jargon journal, no
one seemed either too high or too low for his notice, and Mr Hicks
observed in admiration that he had no need to refer to any note-book
for so much as a single name or address. Paschics was a pitiable
object as he laboured in vain to keep up with his employer’s
dictation. Mansfield had fallen into a state of semi-somnambulism as
he translated into suitable terms, in a purely mechanical way, the
brief instructions he received. Mr Hicks himself was inclined to think
that the ‘Crier’ office on a summer night, with a big sensation coming
in just as the paper had gone to press, was not so much worse than
this; but Cyril showed no sign of hurry or exhaustion as he issued his
directions without a pause, and the pile of papers before him grew
smaller and smaller. The stream of fresh telegrams ceased at last, for
the office was closed for the night, the typewriter rested from its
clicking and clacking; Paschics was engaged upon the last letter.
</p>

<p>
“Is there anything more, Excellency?” he asked, looking up, for Cyril
had suddenly ceased speaking.
</p>

<p>
“I believe not. No, I cannot think of anything more. Hicks,” he turned
to the American, “it’s a curious thing, my brain is an utter blank. If
you asked me what all these letters have been about, I could not tell
you. And yet my head has never been clearer than it was until just
now. It is like the sudden snapping of a thread.”
</p>

<p>
“You had better get to bed at once, Count,” was the answer, the
roughness of which masked a fierce rush of anxiety.
</p>

CHAPTER XX.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub"><i>REDINTEGRATIO AMORIS.</i></span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">To</span> the surprise and delight of Mr Hicks, the attack of brain fever
which he had feared for his patient did not ensue. Cyril remained for
several days in a state of exhaustion amounting to stupor, in which he
displayed no interest in outside affairs, and showed a curious
irritability when the faithful Paschics tried to induce him to take in
hand the routine work which had fallen into arrears during his
absence. Of important business there was happily none to settle, for
Europe was conscious that the master-hand was once more on the reins,
and the anti-Semitic agitation died down as quickly as it had arisen,
without making necessary any very drastic measures. Thus relieved from
anxiety, Cyril turned impatiently from the records of work done, and
copies of answered letters, to which Paschics tried to direct his
attention.
</p>

<p>
“Let me rest, Paschics. Don’t you see I am utterly worn out? Your
letter-books convey no meaning whatever to my mind. If another crisis
arises, you can let me know; but now I must rest.”
</p>

<p>
“Nature is taking her revenge,” said the doctor whom Mr Hicks had felt
it his duty to call in. “His Excellency’s brain has been overworked,
and the cause of the strain is now regarded with loathing. The Count
must take a holiday, and afterwards he will return to business with
fresh zest. When this drowsiness passes off, get him up to Brutli or
one of the other villages on Anti-Lebanon, and let him live in the
open air.”
</p>

<p>
“That doctor is what I call a sensible man,” muttered Cyril drowsily
when the prescription was repeated to him. “Let some one take rooms at
Brutli, and find out whether the Queen has arrived.”
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of these instructions, Mansfield rode up to the village
two or three days later. The hardships of the desert journey had made
no permanent impression upon him, and after a nap which lasted the
better part of two days the brownness of his skin and a hollow look
about his cheeks were the only signs remaining of three weeks’ plain
living and hard riding. He was in the best of spirits when he
dismounted at the door of the inn and inquired of the landlord whether
the Queen’s attendants still had their quarters there. M. Stefanovics,
he found, had been spending the morning at the Institution in
attendance upon her Majesty, but was expected to return shortly, and
General Banics was in his rooms, whither Mansfield betook himself. The
General answered his inquiry for M. Stefanovics with perceptible
stiffness.
</p>

<p>
“I expect my colleague to return to lunch, certainly, but I cannot
answer for his movements. His attendance upon the Queen has occupied a
large proportion of his time of late. Her Majesty is pleased no longer
to seclude herself so completely from the world. I had the honour of
attending her upon a mountain ride yesterday.” At the close of this
long series of brief sentences, General Banics confronted Mansfield
with an expression of great severity, as though to say, “Allude to the
indiscreet revelations made to you on your last visit if you dare!”
</p>

<p>
“I am glad her Majesty is so much better&mdash;in spirits, I mean,”
Mansfield added hastily. “Do you think there is any chance of my being
permitted to see her?”
</p>

<p>
“To see the Queen? you must be mad! And why is her Majesty to receive
you, pray?”
</p>

<p>
“I am the bearer of a message from Count Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
“From Count Mortimer? You did not say that when you were here last.”
</p>

<p>
“It was unnecessary. You did not ask me.”
</p>

<p>
Suspicion and indignation strove for the mastery in General Banics’s
countenance. “Excuse me, I see my colleague coming. I must meet him,”
he said brusquely, and hurried off to intercept M. Stefanovics on his
way across the yard, and inform him of this new development of
affairs. The chamberlain looked aghast.
</p>

<p>
“Did you obtain an interview with her Majesty the last time you were
here, monsieur?” he demanded of Mansfield, plunging violently up the
steps of the verandah as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
“No, I saw no one but a lady-in-waiting named Von Staubach.”
</p>

<p>
“There!” said M. Stefanovics, obviously much relieved, to General
Banics, “you see the change in her Majesty cannot be owing to&mdash;&mdash;” a
reproving glance cut him short, and he turned again to Mansfield. “But
what is your message, monsieur? or is it private?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, not at all. Count Mortimer is ordered to make a short stay at
Brutli for his health, and he is anxious to know whether his presence
here would be disagreeable to her Majesty.”
</p>

<p>
“This is an outrage!” cried M. Stefanovics, almost dancing with rage.
“Is it possible that the man can dare to force his presence again upon
our august mistress, pursuing her even into the solitudes whither she
has retreated to hide her sorrows? He, of all people! Such
shamelessness is incredible.”
</p>

<p>
“Stefanovics, you are a fool!” growled General Banics. “How can it
affect her Majesty if the Count comes here? His movements have no
interest for her. His sending this message is a piece of impertinence.
If you attribute any importance to it, you encourage the man in his
presumption.”
</p>

<p>
“Settle it between yourselves, gentlemen,” said Mansfield mildly. “I
am fortunate in having her Majesty as the final court of appeal.”
</p>

<p>
M. Stefanovics dragged the General aside, and they talked rapidly and
emphatically for some minutes, such sentences reaching Mansfield as,
“Can he have written already?” “He is aiming at re-establishing his
old ascendency.” “He thinks that by coming here ill he will move her
pity.”
</p>

<p>
“Monsieur,” said M. Stefanovics, returning, and addressing Mansfield
with a judicial air, “we wish to know whether your master has any
ulterior object in this extraordinary proceeding?”
</p>

<p>
“Really,” replied Mansfield, with extreme innocence, “I can’t say.”
</p>

<p>
“But does he entertain any hopes&mdash;any designs&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“If you will be so good as to ask me a plain question, monsieur, I
will try to give you a plain answer.”
</p>

<p>
“Then is he hoping to resume his old position with her Majesty?”
</p>

<p>
“May I ask what that was?”
</p>

<p>
“He was privately betrothed to her.”
</p>

<p>
“If it was private, how is it that you know anything about it?”
</p>

<p>
Confusion kept M. Stefanovics silent for a moment. “Madame Stefanovics
was in the secret,” he said at last, “and when the affair terminated,
she revealed the whole thing to me, in her indignation against Count
Mortimer.”
</p>

<p>
“You and your wife are a pair of chatterboxes!” cried General Banics
suddenly, in a fury of indignation. “No secrets are safe with you.”
</p>

<p>
“Thank you, General,” said Mansfield warmly; “I accept the reproof.
Count Mortimer’s secrets are safe with me. Not even to you will I
reveal them.”
</p>

<p>
M. Stefanovics had been speechless and almost black in the face with
rage, but his delight on hearing his colleague thus hoist with his own
petard relieved his mind, and he broke into a shout of laughter.
</p>

<p>
“Aha, General, the Englishman is too clever for us! Come, monsieur,
what is it you ask?”
</p>

<p>
“All I want you to do is to let me wait in the anteroom while you
carry the message to the Queen, so that I may be at hand if her
Majesty is pleased to wish to ask me anything.”
</p>

<p>
“Excellent!” said M. Stefanovics, his good-humour quite restored.
“Your demands are commendably moderate, monsieur. You will join us at
lunch first?”
</p>

<p>
The meal passed off peacefully, although General Banics preserved a
persistent silence and an expression of cold contempt towards both
Mansfield and M. Stefanovics, and when it became his duty to conduct
the uninvited guest to the Institution in the afternoon, he relieved
the monotony of the climb by a single remark only.
</p>

<p>
“Understand, monsieur,” he burst out, standing still in the middle of
the pathway, and glaring down at Mansfield, who was following him, “if
your master succeeds in adding so much as a finger’s weight to her
Majesty’s sorrows, I will kill him in her very presence!”
</p>

<p>
“There would be two people to reckon with in such a case, General&mdash;her
Majesty and Count Mortimer himself,” said Mansfield, with great
calmness. “It will be time enough, surely, to avenge the Queen when
she asks for your help?”
</p>

<p>
The cool reasonableness of this speech stung the General to the quick,
and uttering an inarticulate grunt, he turned to resume the march up
the hill. Arrived at the Institution, he left Mansfield in the
deaconesses’ guest-chamber, while he went to inquire the Queen’s
pleasure, returning shortly, with a very bad grace, to say that her
Majesty desired his attendance. The Queen was sitting in a marble
verandah, which looked upon a small enclosed garden, warm and bright
in spite of the advanced season of the year, and musical with
fountains. Madame Stefanovics, a lady almost as stout and
comfortable-looking as her husband, was with her, but when General
Banics had presented Mansfield and retired to the door, she also
retreated out of earshot, and Ernestine gave her visitor a significant
smile.
</p>

<p>
“We must not shock Banics,” she said. “He does not know that I have
ever seen you before. But tell me, is the Count’s illness serious?”
her voice shook with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, madame. It is merely over-fatigue from the journey.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, the sheikh told me of your wonderful adventures. But I was
terrified when Banics said he was ill. You see, in his case I cannot
be sure whether his illnesses are merely&mdash;political, or whether he is
making light of a serious malady for reasons of state.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, madame, this attack is genuine, but only temporary, I am
sure.”
</p>

<p>
The confident assurance brought the smile again to the Queen’s face.
“He must recover quickly, for I am all impatience to see him. There is
so much to be arranged, you know. Only the ladies are in the secret,
and I have left Anna Mirkovics to act as my deputy at Sitt Zeynab.
Banics and Stefanovics must hear of the betrothal before it is
announced to the world. They have been so faithful to me. You will
tell the Count this?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly, madame. Does your Majesty wish to send him any other
message?”
</p>

<p>
“Tell him”&mdash;she paused, and the smile grew dazzling&mdash;“give him all the
messages you would wish to receive were you in his place. You
understand?”
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand, and Mansfield kissed it and retired in a state
of ecstatic confusion. Philippa was Philippa still, and there was no
one like her in all the world, but here was a woman in whose cause a
man might joyfully die, and dying, ask no reward but a glance from her
eyes. Once Mansfield had wondered at Cyril’s renewed devotion to the
Queen, which seemed so foreign to his character, and was kept in such
strict subjection by his own will, but since he had seen her he had
ceased to wonder. No man who had once succumbed to her charm of
manner, however valiantly he might struggle against it, could ever
escape from his bondage to those smiles. Mansfield felt no surprise at
the fierceness with which General Banics was prepared to defend his
mistress. It was only natural. In the General’s circumstances,
Mansfield would have been impelled to do the same himself.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Two days later, Cyril, with his train of attendants, was established
in the village inn, to the huge delight of the landlord, whose
self-satisfaction made itself felt even in Damascus, leading, as it
did, to visions of a huge hotel, to be built <i>alla Franca</i> on the site
of the present modest edifice, and to become renowned throughout the
Levant as a sanatorium. On the evening of Cyril’s arrival, General
Banics, with fierce disinclination bristling in every hair of his
moustache, took his way across the courtyard in uniform to inquire
after his health, and to intimate that her Majesty had been pleased to
consent to receive him the next day. The reception was a very formal,
full-dress affair, designed for the sole benefit of the Thracian
officials and Fräulein von Staubach, who had been excluded from the
secret of the desert reconciliation owing to a well-grounded distrust
of her discretion. Still, since she believed firmly that the Queen had
returned to ordinary life solely on account of her letter, despatched
after Mansfield’s first visit to Brutli, she was not without her
compensations. Everything was done with great ceremony, and the
deaconesses and their Syrian flock were duly impressed, while Cyril
was so much exhausted that he could scarcely mount his horse to ride
back to the inn. The suggestion of the formal audience had been his
own, however, and his return was followed by a message brought by M.
Stefanovics, to the effect that her Majesty had been grieved to see
how ill Count Mortimer was looking, and that she hoped he would avail
himself of her pleasant sheltered garden whenever he felt well enough
to be out of doors. It was not to be expected that his presence should
exclude the Queen from her own domain, or that their meeting there
should be marked by the formality of the state reception, and towards
the end of the first afternoon Fräulein von Staubach, who had been in
attendance, crept noiselessly into the house, and ran to the room
where Baroness von Hilfenstein and Madame Stefanovics were sitting.
</p>

<p>
“It is all settled! They are reconciled, the betrothal is renewed!”
she cried rapturously. “I saw them exchange flowers&mdash;roses and sprays
of myrtle. Oh, I was sure it would come right! I just slipped in to
tell you. I could not wait.”
</p>

<p>
“But how can you be certain?” asked Madame Stefanovics cautiously.
</p>

<p>
“Certain! I shall ask her Majesty,” was the reply, as Fräulein von
Staubach slipped back to her post. It was with the freedom of a
privileged confidant that she attacked the Queen that evening.
</p>

<p>
“Dearest madame, may we not be allowed to congratulate you? Is not
something going to happen that will make us all very happy? You know
that your happiness is ours.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so, Sophie? Then you must be very happy at this moment.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed I am, madame. May I make the rest happy too?”
</p>

<p>
“No; I will tell Banics and Stefanovics myself,” said the Queen, and
she did so the next morning. Whatever their secret thoughts were upon
the matter, they appreciated their mistress’s consideration in
communicating the news personally, and crushed down their feelings
nobly when they congratulated Cyril. There was to be no secrecy this
time about the betrothal. If Cyril had desired any delay in the
announcement, he could not have asked it, with the memory of that
twelve years’ engagement, which Ernestine had accepted with such
unwillingness, and which had ended so sadly, fresh in his mind. They
exchanged rings, therefore, in German fashion, and after taking this
decisive step, notified their respective relations of the
understanding to which they had come.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the news filtered down into the village through the
gossip of the servants, and quickly reached Colonel Czartoriski at
Damascus by the agency of one of the men employed at the inn, with
whom he had bargained to keep him informed of all that went on.
Unfortunately, however, the announcement that the Queen had begun to
appear in public and to receive visitors only arrived at the same
time; so that he found it was too late to carry out his orders and
anticipate a reconciliation. In this dilemma he telegraphed to the
Princess of Dardania for instructions, receiving the prompt reply,
“Deliver my letter to her immediately,” and this he proceeded at once
to do. It was with the utmost reluctance that Ernestine consented to
receive him. The shrinking dread of her cousin, with which the
sufferings endured at her hands had filled her, made her feel
instinctively that the request boded ill to her new happiness, and she
was only partially reassured by the reminder from her ladies that
Colonel Czartoriski had been entreating an opportunity of delivering
his mistress’s letter for months past, so that it could not possibly
be concerned with the engagement. She received the visitor with the
utmost formality, accepted at his hands the packet with which he was
charged, made and answered the customary polite inquiries, and
dismissed him, graciously but with marked coldness. She was not by
nature a vindictive woman, but the injuries which the Princess of
Dardania had done her were such as she could never forgive.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, Cyril, lounging idly on the grass beside one of
the fountains in the garden, was disturbed by Fräulein von Staubach,
who told him that the Queen wished to speak to him, adding the
gratuitous information that her Majesty was very much troubled about
something. He found Ernestine, as usual, in the marble verandah which
served her as a presence-chamber. She had an open letter before her,
and her face was very pale as she looked up at him.
</p>

<p>
“Cyril,” she said fearfully, “this comes from my cousin Ottilie.”
</p>

<p>
“Now for it!” was Cyril’s inward comment, as he braced himself to meet
the blow, the imminence of which had been little present to his mind
of late. “I hope it hasn’t brought you any bad news?” he added, with a
coolness which he was far from feeling, but which tended to reassure
the Queen.
</p>

<p>
“I have only looked at the first page,” she said; “but I can see that
it is an attack upon you. She says that you have injured her
deeply&mdash;that you belong to her, and not to me. Cyril, I must know, I
must be sure! Do you love her? have you ever loved her?”
</p>

<p>
“I have never loved her, and I don’t now.”
</p>

<p>
“You have never asked her to marry you?”
</p>

<p>
“Never.”
</p>

<p>
“Then that is all I want to know.” She sprang up, and lifting the
perforated cover from the <i>mangal</i>, or brazier, which stood close to
the divan, threw the letter upon the glowing charcoal. “I won’t read
any more. I am not interested in what she says against you. If you had
really belonged to her, I would have given you up, though it would
have broken my heart; but I can trust you, Cyril, and I do. You may
have injured her, as she says&mdash;I know I am shut out of your political
schemes,” she smiled sadly, “and I don’t ask how or why it was&mdash;but it
was not in that way.”
</p>

<p>
“My dearest, I wish I was more worthy of your trust.”
</p>

<p>
“Trust me, my beloved; I shall always trust you.”
</p>

<p>
The subject of the unread letter was not again touched upon between
them, but Ernestine did not forget it. She had a conviction that
Colonel Czartoriski would linger in the neighbourhood in order to
watch the effect of his embassy, and inform his mistress of the
result. That very evening she caught a glimpse of him, half-concealed
among the trees by the wayside, watching her as she rode. This was
merely what she had expected, and she had prepared a disappointment
for him. Turning and beckoning with smiling imperiousness to Cyril,
who was close behind, she reined in her horse that he might ride
beside her. As they rode, she engaged him in a low-toned confidential
conversation, quite contrary to her wont in public, stretching out a
hand the while to play with his horse’s mane. A second glance showed
her presently that Colonel Czartoriski had seen enough, and was
retreating down the road, with defeat in all his aspect, and she shook
her riding-whip at his unconscious form.
</p>

<p>
“Go and tell your mistress exactly what you saw!” she cried
passionately, and laughed at the sudden dawn of comprehension in
Cyril’s face.
</p>

<p>
Baffled in his quest, Colonel Czartoriski left Brutli, acting upon
instructions from the Princess of Dardania, and a few days of intense
quiet and happiness succeeded his departure. The unfeigned joy felt by
all the attendants of the betrothed pair in their reconciliation was
reflected in the faces of the deaconesses and their Syrian peasants,
and smiling looks and gifts of flowers or fruit greeted both Cyril and
Ernestine everywhere. Even the melancholy Paschics went about with a
beaming countenance and a flower in his buttonhole, and Mr Hicks’s
characteristic pessimism displayed itself only in a remark aside to
Mansfield, to the effect that this was the calm before the storm. What
he wanted to know was, what would all those European kings think about
it?
</p>

<p>
It happened that the Chevalier Goldberg was at the Schloss at
Vindobona, closeted with the Emperor on a matter of high financial
importance, when the Queen’s letter to her Pannonian kinsfolk arrived.
The Chevalier had received the news of the engagement by telegram some
days before, and therefore his presence at the palace on this
particular morning may or may not have been accidental.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Goldberg, so our friend Mortimer is to marry Queen Ernestine?”
said the Emperor, returning to the room after being summoned away by a
message from the Empress.
</p>

<p>
“So I have heard, sir.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, no one is likely to offer any real objection. The Emperor
Sigismund will dislike the idea, no doubt, but he has no means of
coercing the Queen, and her son’s past treatment of her debars him
from putting in a claim to interfere. But it is a preposterous affair,
for Mortimer is little better than a beggar. I thought, Goldberg, that
you financiers always made a point of paying your instruments well,
that they might do you credit?”
</p>

<p>
“I have sometimes thought, sir, that your Majesty, and I, and the
Syndicate I represent, and various other important people, are only
the instruments&mdash;the pawns, if you will&mdash;of this little Englishman,
who plays because it interests him to move the pieces.”
</p>

<p>
The Emperor smiled. “We shall have to do something for him, I
suppose,” he said. “Is there anything that strikes you as particularly
suitable?”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, sir, your Majesty knows that there is one post for which Count
Mortimer is supremely fitted. His appointment to it would be welcomed
with acclamation by the Jews all over the world.”
</p>

<p>
“You are sure of that? Well, I will set on foot negotiations. I am
uneasy&mdash;in common with the whole Catholic world&mdash;about those fortified
convents which Scythia has for years been so busy erecting on every
point of vantage round Jerusalem. At the present moment I think we
should be able to make her see reason; but when this famine is
over&mdash;&mdash;! But the Jews must be unanimous, Chevalier. That is
indispensable.”
</p>

<p>
“I cannot conceive that any opposition could arise, sir.”
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, Goldberg, is Mortimer marrying the Queen in order to become
Prince of Palestine, or seeking to become Prince of Palestine that he
may marry the Queen?”
</p>

<p>
“I cannot say, sir. I can only surmise that it will be the proudest
moment of his life when he can lay his coronet at her Majesty’s feet.”
</p>

<p>
“You are diplomatic. After all, his motives do not concern us.”
</p>

<p>
“May I entreat a favour of your Majesty? My friend has done me the
honour to invite me to assist at his wedding, and if I might be
permitted to inform him of the gracious intentions with which&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“You may intimate in private the probable course of events, but not
publicly. When is the wedding? Not settled? Oh, you need not try to
deceive me for politeness’ sake, Chevalier. It is better that I should
not know until it is all over. Make it a <i>chose jugée</i>; there is no
going behind that, you know. The sooner the better.”
</p>

<p>
The day after this interview had taken place at Vindobona, a letter
from Cyril reached Llandiarmid, communicating the great news to Lord
Caerleon, and containing a proposal which excited the younger members
of the family almost to the verge of lunacy.

“I want you to do something for me, Caerleon. Will you bring Nadia and
the young ones to Damascus for the wedding? I need not tell you what a
pleasure your presence would be to me, and Ernestine would appreciate
the kindness deeply, especially as none of her own family are likely
to be here. You need give yourselves no trouble. Goldberg has taken
Ormsea’s yacht, the White Lady, for a year or two, and will pick you
up at Brindisi and bring you straight to Beyrout. He is charged also
with the duty of securing the parson, for there does not happen to be
an English clergyman here at this moment, and we have decided that it
would be unfair to ask any of the German missionaries to officiate,
since they stand in such abject terror of the Emperor Sigismund. I
have made up my mind you will all come. Bring Wright with you, if you
can tear the old fellow away from domestic joys. It will be something
for him to remember all the rest of his life. It is just possible that
there may be some further sights and ceremonies that will interest you
after the wedding; but I don’t want to estimate prematurely the yield
of the international incubator. Telegraph to Goldberg at Venice if you
can come, and entreat Nadia&mdash;for Ernestine’s sake, for my sake, for
any sake&mdash;to leave her Needlework Guild and Nursing Association and
Society for Making People Virtuous by Act of Parliament to take care
of themselves for a month or so, and to give the bride the support of
her presence. I know you’ll come, old man.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>Oh</i>, father!” burst from Philippa, as her father finished reading
the letter aloud. “Oh, mother!”
</p>

<p>
“You feel that we ought to go, Carlino?” said Lady Caerleon.
</p>

<p>
“Now, how did you know that? Well, yes, I do.”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Philippa; “and Usk’s vacation begins to-morrow. He
can meet us in London as we pass through. It all fits in beautifully.
To see Uncle Cyril married, and to a Queen! It’s like a book&mdash;like an
old romance. Don’t you feel as if you were a Crusader, father? To go
to Palestine, and all this as well!”

CHAPTER XXI.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">A NEW FACTOR.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">The</span> gracious gentleman will pardon me, but&mdash;he has the appearance
of a divine of the English Church?”
</p>

<p>
The young clergyman who was standing watching the pigeons in the
Piazza San Marco turned and looked curiously at the deferential Jew
who had addressed him in English. “Certainly, I am a clergyman of the
Church of England,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“Will the gracious divine do me the favour to accompany me on board
the yacht White Lady, which is lying in the lagoon? There is one of
his compatriots who stands in urgent need of his ghostly services.”
</p>

<p>
“The White Lady? That’s Lord Ormsea’s yacht, isn’t it? I’m afraid Lord
Ormsea would not consider me very sound, from his point of view, but
if he told you to fetch any clergyman you met, no doubt the case is
urgent. Yes, of course I’ll come. What is the matter with the sick
person?”
</p>

<p>
“I was not told, gracious sir. If the venerable divine will give
himself the trouble to step this way, I have a gondola waiting.”
</p>

<p>
There was the usual mass of tourists and idlers thronging the
Piazzetta as the clergyman followed his guide through it, and he did
not observe that the Jew exchanged signals with a co-religionist in
the crowd, who disappeared immediately. Ill informed as the messenger
seemed to be as to the cause of his embassy, he was an eminently
conversational person. The sight of the Giudecca, as they passed it,
set flowing such a stream of historical reminiscence that the
clergyman listened in fascinated silence, and scarcely noticed the
length of the journey, or the fact that the yacht was lying close to
the Porto di Lido, in readiness to proceed to sea. It struck him,
however, as strange that the sailors who were at hand to help him up
the side made no reference to the invalid for whose benefit he had
been summoned on board, and that the Jew hurried him across the deck
before he could reply to the captain’s civil words of welcome.
Understanding that the owner was in the saloon, he followed his guide
below, and found himself in the presence, not of that militant
Neo-Anglican, Lord Ormsea, but of a stout, bearded gentleman of
unmistakably Hebraic appearance.
</p>

<p>
“De Referend Alexander Chudson, I think?” said the stranger, coming
forward with outstretched hand. “My dear sir, I am unspeakably
grateful to you for hurryink so promptly to de assistance off my poor
frient.”
</p>

<p>
“I beg your pardon, I understood I was coming on board Lord Ormsea’s
yacht?” said Mr Judson diffidently. His host laughed.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, den you hef not heard det I hef hired de White Lady for three
years? I shell take her to Cowes next summer. Permit me to introdooce
myself&mdash;de Chefalier Goldberg, off de house off Goldberg Frères,
Findobona and Lutetia.”
</p>

<p>
Mr Judson bowed and murmured politely. “Will you kindly let me see the
sick person at once?” he added. “I never like losing a moment in these
cases.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier waved his hands. “Pressently, pressently, my dear sir.
But what did you say&mdash;de sick person? Dere iss no one sick.”
</p>

<p>
“Surely I haven’t come to the wrong ship, have I? I understood from
the messenger that there was an Englishman on board dangerously
ill&mdash;and he brought me here.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, dere iss some mistake! Did det fool employ dose words?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, now that I remember, he did not exactly. He said that the man
needed my ghostly services, I believe.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, det explains de metter!” cried the Chevalier, laughing joyously.
“It iss to merry de Englishman, not to bury him, det you are wanted,
my dear sir.”
</p>

<p>
“But that’s impossible!” cried the clergyman, starting back. “The
marriage would not be legal.”
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier’s countenance exhibited every sign of the deepest
dejection. “But dis iss a blow!” he cried. “What iss de law, referend
sir?”
</p>

<p>
Mr Judson’s own mind was not quite clear about the matter, but he did
his best to give reasons for his very definite impression that the
celebration of the marriage of a British subject in foreign parts,
without the presence of one of Her Majesty’s representatives, would
render all concerned in it liable to divers pains and penalties. The
Chevalier heard him to the end with great politeness, putting
questions now and then which led the conversation into pleasant little
legal byways, and finally observed complacently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“But dis will be all right, you see, for de merrich iss to take place
at Damascus, and de British Consul will be dere.”
</p>

<p>
“Damascus! But you said it was to be on board. What!&mdash;why&mdash;we are
moving!”
</p>

<p>
“We hef been mofink some time, my dear sir. You are on your way to
Syria, where de bride and bridegroom are waitink.”
</p>

<p>
“But this is intolerable, sir! This is kidnapping!”
</p>

<p>
“It shell be my endeafour to make it fery tolerable to you, my dear
sir&mdash;an agreeable extension off your holiday, det iss all.”
</p>

<p>
“But I must go back to my work. I am expected.”
</p>

<p>
“Now, come,” the Chevalier laid a paternal hand on Mr Judson’s
coat-sleeve, “be reassonable, my dear sir. Your luggich iss all
brought on board. My achent hess telegrephed to your rector det you
are summoned suddenly to Pelestine. Your bill at de hotel iss paid, de
proprietor iss told det you are unexpectedly called away. Eferythink
iss complete, no mystery, no trouble.”
</p>

<p>
“Really, I think you are the coolest hand I ever met.”
</p>

<p>
“You compliment me too much. See, you receife your pessich out and
home again, and fife hundret pounts for your <i>douceur</i>&mdash;your fee. You
gif your rector ten pounts for his fafourite Society&mdash;it iss for de
confersion off de Chews, iss it not?&mdash;and you go beck and tell him
more about de Chews den he efer knew before.”
</p>

<p>
There was a malicious twinkle in the curate’s eye. “Now, how in the
world did you guess that we were interested in the Jews at our place?”
</p>

<p>
“You hef been seen wanderink about de Giudecca, you hef spoken to many
Chews in oder parts off Fenice, and asked dem questions about deir
faith.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s true. I have made many inquiries of them, and for a very good
reason. You will be interested to know that I am the son of Salathiel
Yehudi, the converted Jew, who has spent the greater part of his life
at Baghdad, as a missionary to his own people.”
</p>

<p>
An instantaneous change swept over the Chevalier’s smiling face. “Det
apostate!” he cried, then took refuge in Hebrew, “that vile serpent!
that betrayer of Israel! and I have welcomed his son on board my
ship!”
</p>

<p>
“You will allow me to remind you that I had no desire to come on board
your ship, and that I am quite ready to leave it.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me. You understend Hebrew? I should not hef thought&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“My father has brought us all up to claim our share in the privileges
of our race. We are proud of being Israelites, I assure you. But,” as
the Chevalier shuddered involuntarily, “perhaps you will now be kind
enough to put me on shore?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear sir, what iss det you say? put you on shore? No, no, you are
needed. You hef studied de phenomena off de pressent Return? You hef
heard off Count Mortimer? He it iss det dessires your serfices. He iss
to merry de moder off de King of Thracia, and dere are reassons off
state why it should be done quietly.”
</p>

<p>
“But, my good sir, why go about it in this theatrical fashion? If I
chose to make a fuss, I could set Europe ringing with your
extraordinary proceedings.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you do not know: I hef tried. I meet an English clerchyman, an
old acquaintance, at Fenice: I engache him to sail wid me and perform
dis merrich, gifink him no names. He agrees. What should suddenly
possess him to write to his wife and tell her about de mysterious
business, so det de lady telegrephs beck ‘Must be somethink wronk.
Inform de police and return home.’ My dear sir, det referend men left
Fenice at once, and telegrephed to me from de frontier to say det he
was gone. He also informed de police of de metter, and dey suspect me
of intendink to kidnep an heiress&mdash;me! Dey would hef detained de
yacht, I beliefe, if I hed stayed here lonker. Det iss why I kidnep
you.”
</p>

<p>
“But really, you know&mdash;How am I to be sure that it’s all right?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear sir, you shell hef a prifate interfiew wid de bridegroom
before de ceremony&mdash;wid de Queen also, if she will consent to receife
you. But I am forgettink. De Count’s broder, de Marquis off Caerleon,
iss comink on board at Brindisi wid his femily, to assist et de
weddink. If you are not setisfied when you hef seen dem, you shell
leafe de ship at once. Now are you confinced off my <i>bona fides</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“Quite,” said the clergyman politely. He did not mention that during
his theological course at Latimer Hall, he had met Lord Usk two or
three times on Sunday evenings at the Principal’s, but the
recollection afforded him a distinct gratification. If his host had
provided another trap for him, he had at any rate the means of turning
the tables.
</p>

<p>
But it was undoubtedly the genuine Usk who came on board at Brindisi
with his parents and sister, and showed himself as delighted to meet a
fellow-Man (in the Cambridge sense) as Mr Judson was to see him. Thus
reassured, the curate was quite satisfied to fall in with the
arrangement so unceremoniously made for him. The Chevalier treated his
guests with princely hospitality, and the voyage was pleasant and
uneventful. The only cloud on the horizon appeared at Larnaka, where
the Chevalier found waiting for him at his agent’s some news that
perturbed him considerably. He discussed it at length with his
secretary and two or three of the chief Jews of the place, then sent
off several long telegrams to Damascus, and returned to his guests
with his usual cheerfulness restored.
</p>

<p>
“I hef put it all in your broder’s hends, my lord,” he said gleefully
to Lord Caerleon, who expressed a hope that he had not received bad
news. “I hef thrown it upon his shoulders, and I feel safe. He will
not fail me.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier’s telegrams were opened by Paschics, who rode into
Damascus daily in order to keep the office-work from falling into
arrears, and now returned immediately to Brutli with a peremptory
demand for Count Mortimer’s presence in the city, since a fresh crisis
had arisen with which he alone could deal. Cyril’s disinclination for
work was as marked as it had been when his illness began, but he
allowed himself to be dragged from his pleasant lotos-eating existence
by the ruthless Paschics, and swept with his whole train down to
Damascus. The imperious summons was all the more distasteful, since
Ernestine was intending to leave Brutli for the city the next day. The
house, which had been placed at her disposal by a wealthy German
merchant who had married a former deaconess, would not be ready to
receive her until the time originally fixed, so that she would be
deprived of Cyril’s escort on the journey. Paschics saw, or thought he
saw, that he had incurred his leader’s deep displeasure by his
persistence in demanding his return, and as soon as the cavalcade was
out of sight of the Institution, he pressed forward to Cyril’s side.
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, Excellency, it is absolutely necessary. There is&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, don’t din the whole thing into me just now, Paschics. When we get
to Damascus will be time enough. I can’t think when I am riding.”
</p>

<p>
Paschics fell back to his former station, trying to remember whether
he had ever heard his employer object hitherto to thinking in any
circumstances. He himself was thoroughly alarmed by the crisis, and he
half feared that Cyril failed to realise its seriousness. As soon as
they reached the house he hurried him into the room where they had
been accustomed to work; and while Mr Hicks sat down to examine a
series of urgent telegrams which had arrived for him, and Mansfield
uncovered the typewriter in readiness to begin operations, he
summarised as tersely as possible the state of affairs described by
the Chevalier’s correspondents.
</p>

<p>
Ten days before, the readers of all the more important papers
throughout Europe had found themselves confronted by an advertisement
bidding them to “Look out for the Yellow Pamphlet!” The advertisement
appeared each succeeding day in a different position and in different
type, and a week after its first insertion the Yellow Pamphlet burst
upon the world. The newsvendors were laden with it, the bookstalls
groaned under it, and it was sent gratuitously to vast numbers of
prominent people everywhere, especially among the Jews. Printed in
English, French, German, and Jargon, it made its appearance
simultaneously all over Europe, Egypt, and Algeria; and it was a
significant fact that the Anti-Semitic papers, together with a good
many journals which were not supposed to share their views, devoted a
large portion of their issue on the day of its publication to quoting
from its contents and drawing inferences from them. Enormous as the
cost of production must have been, the <i>brochure</i> had sold, said the
telegrams, in such numbers that it was probable it would bring an
appreciable profit to its proprietor. Its title was “The Syndicate and
its Hero,” and it was addressed to all honest men. With an affectation
of judicial impartiality which rendered its statements all the more
damaging, it set out to prove that the United Nation Syndicate,
despite its professedly philanthropic object, was in reality nothing
less than a scheme for rendering the Jews absolutely masters of the
world. The steps by which, under Cyril’s leadership, the Syndicate had
coerced one government after another, until it had borne down all
opposition to its Palestine scheme, were traced with as much
minuteness as was requisite to vouch for the writer’s knowledge of his
subject. Then came the application. Practice had made perfect, and
there was no room for doubt that the machinery, tested by means of
these various trial trips, as they might be called, would quickly be
used for larger ends. The world lay helpless at the feet of the Jew,
but&mdash;it was for the Jew to consider whether this triumph was not
likely to be too dearly bought.
</p>

<p>
Having exposed the real nature of the aims of the Syndicate, the
pamphlet proceeded to deal with its hero&mdash;Cyril. Between Count
Mortimer and the Jews there existed an unholy alliance, by virtue of
which he was to be raised to a position commensurate with his
ambitious designs, in return for his betrayal of Christendom. His
first attempt to make himself Prince of Palestine had been balked by
the address of the lady to whom he had confided his schemes, and the
sturdy honesty of Dr Texelius; but he had found a more adaptable tool.
Another lady, whose former history was not unconnected with his own,
and who, on his fall, had quitted society in a fit of pique at her
loss of political power, was willing to return to it in any capacity
that might offer her a scope for a fancied talent of intrigue. Thus
worthily supported, Count Mortimer had proceeded, in the most
barefaced manner, to force himself upon the world as the only possible
ruler of Palestine, as a conjurer forces a particular card upon his
audience. He had openly assumed the title of Prince of the Jews, and
in that name had traversed Palestine and the surrounding countries
from end to end, making treaties on his own authority, and organising
a <i>plébiscite</i> which was designed to give his usurpation the
semblance of legality. This desirable end effected, he would continue
to play into the hands of the Syndicate, with the added prestige of
place and power to assist him, while they would maintain and
strengthen his position by virtue of their command of the world’s
finance. The position would be a proud one for him, no doubt; but was
it worth while for the Jews to drive Europe to desperation, and bring
upon themselves universal hatred, which was only too likely to lead to
universal reprisals, merely in order to provide a throne for Count
Mortimer?
</p>

<p>
Thus far the Yellow Pamphlet. The telegrams added that on the
afternoon of the day of publication representatives of the press had
interviewed a number of the prominent personages in various countries
to whom it had been sent. On the subject of the revelations contained
in it, the utmost horror and detestation was expressed by one and all
of those appealed to. Everywhere the timid, cowering before the
prospect of popular fury, sought to save themselves by sacrificing
some one else, and the bold rejoiced cynically in the chance of
ridding themselves of a severe master. The scapegoat was the same in
both cases. All the Hebrews who conceived themselves to have any
grudge against Cyril&mdash;Texelius, the theoretical republican Rubenssohn,
the English Jews, the schemers he had disappointed at Jerusalem and
Alexandria&mdash;displayed the most engaging ignorance of any political
designs on the part of their nation. It had never entered their minds
that the Syndicate could have any but a purely philanthropic object;
but if they had been misled, let it be summarily crushed as soon as
its work in acquiring Palestine was done. In any case it was clear
that Count Mortimer must be thrown overboard. He had traded upon the
guileless simplicity of the Hebrew community in order to secure his
own advancement, and corrupted the innocence of its keenest minds.
There would be justice as well as policy in flinging him to the wolves
that were clamouring for Jewish blood.
</p>

<p>
This prompt repudiation of Cyril and all his ways had proved so
convincing to the general public that the mob which had set out to
wreck the Jewish houses remained to acclaim their owners, and Semite
and Anti-Semite were exchanging pledges of eternal friendship all over
Europe. Before the joint influence of fear and interest, the United
Nation collapsed like a house of cards. The kings of finance, who had
no sentimental care for Palestine&mdash;Paris, rather than Jerusalem,
flaunting herself as the Holy City of their gilded dreams&mdash;had at
first yielded unwillingly to the Chevalier’s enthusiasm, backed up by
the monetary pressure he had contrived to exert, and now welcomed the
opportunity of throwing off the yoke. The orthodox Rabbis, who, with a
few exceptions, had used all their influence in opposition to the
Zionist movement, and had viewed its progress with fear and aversion,
as likely to transfer their power to the hands of the free-thinking
Jews and such enthusiasts as Rabbi Schaul, gloried openly in the
<i>exposé</i>. The rank and file of the Children of Zion alone remained
faithful. Thus the Jewish world was split in two, and the unanimity
demanded by the Emperor of Pannonia was absolutely unattainable.
</p>

<p>
Paschics laid down the last telegram, and looked expectantly at his
employer.
</p>

<p>
“This is the sort of thing that only a woman would do, and there is
only one woman who could have done it,” said Cyril. He was playing
idly with a paper-knife as he sat at the table.
</p>

<p>
“But what is to be done, Excellency?” demanded Paschics, with anxious
eagerness. Cyril buried his face in his hands without replying, and
sat silent for some time. When he raised his head his face was
haggard.
</p>

<p>
“Leave it for a while,” he said. “Mansfield, get out the chessboard,
and we will have a game.”
</p>

<p>
The others stared at him in bewilderment, but Mansfield obeyed. It had
become rather unusual for them to play, since Cyril invariably won,
which deprived the contests of all their interest. This time, however,
Mansfield won easily. To his astonishment he saw great drops standing
on his employer’s brow when he looked up.
</p>

<p>
“Another!” said Cyril hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
Mansfield set the board afresh, and perceiving from his antagonist’s
keen anxiety that he attached some special importance to this
particular game, determined to play so carelessly as to make it
impossible for him not to win. Perhaps he was in the mood to regard a
victory here as a good omen for his success with regard to the larger
issues at stake. But Cyril saw the intention, and dashed his fist down
on the board.
</p>

<p>
“For heaven’s sake, Mansfield, don’t humour me as if I was a child! I
haven’t come to that yet. Play your hardest.”
</p>

<p>
Rearranging the pieces, Mansfield obeyed, and won the game with
ludicrous ease, not daring to glance at his opponent’s face. Cyril sat
for a moment playing with the pieces, then pushed his chair back and
stood up.
</p>

<p>
“I believe my brain’s gone,” he said unsteadily. “I can think of
nothing. The game is up, Paschics. It must all go.”
</p>

<p>
“Land’s sake, Count!” cried Mr Hicks, “bluff it out. You’ll be all
right in a day or two. Bluff will carry you through yet.”
</p>

<p>
“It may, but I feel pretty certain it won’t. No, Hicks, I’m cornered.
Do your best with it, Paschics. Oh, to be for one hour&mdash;for ten
minutes&mdash;the man I was a month ago! But that’s all over now.”
</p>

<p>
“Say, Count, you’re sick yet,” Mr Hicks cried after him as he went
out. “You bet you’ll be as spry as ever some time soon. Mr Mansfield,”
he added hastily, “if I were you I guess I’d give Dietrich the word to
keep an eye on his master, and not leave any shooting-irons lying
around.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield rushed out with frantic haste, and Mr Hicks and the
horrified Paschics put their heads together and drew up a document
which might help to postpone the need of an explanation for a day or
two. Count Mortimer was still suffering from the effects of the
dastardly attack made upon him at Jericho, but he left his character
and his cause confidently in the hands of Europe, in the full
assurance that, until he was able to vindicate them himself, judgment
would be suspended. When this had been despatched, there was no more
that they could do. If Cyril did not regain his former powers of mind,
all, as he had said, was lost.
</p>

<p>
He returned to the room after about an hour of restless pacing up and
down upon the house-top, with Mansfield, who fondly believed himself
unseen, dogging him from behind the trellis the whole time. He seemed
to have shaken off for the present the horror which had seized him in
its grip, and apologised for his agitation, after approving the steps
which Paschics had taken.
</p>

<p>
“I must see a specialist,” he added carelessly, “and no doubt he will
be able to put me right. Not a word of this, please, especially to the
Queen. And, Mansfield, you will be interested to know that I don’t
intend to commit suicide just at present, so that you need not devote
your leisure hours to keeping me in view.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
“Ernestine, are you on good terms with your cousin Prince Ramon of
Arragon?”
</p>

<p>
“He and his wife called upon me this afternoon&mdash;before we were at all
settled, indeed. I think they mean to be friendly. But were you
thinking of inviting them to the&mdash;the wedding, Cyril?”
</p>

<p>
“Not for a moment. I was wondering whether Prince Ramon would object
to my consulting him professionally?”
</p>

<p>
Don Ramon of Arragon was the representative of one of those junior
branches of the Pannonian Imperial house which have been deprived of
political power by the changes of the nineteenth century. Far from
murmuring over his loss of sovereignty, he had accepted the inevitable
with marked satisfaction, and devoted himself to the study of
medicine, giving his services freely to all who chose to consult him.
He was now well known as a specialist in diseases of the brain, and
rumour said that even his pious intention in visiting Palestine was
not unmixed with the desire of investigating certain forms of madness
supposed to be peculiar to the East.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I’m sure he would not mind,” said the Queen eagerly. “But, Cyril,
you said you were so much better.”
</p>

<p>
“My head doesn’t feel quite as clear as it ought, that’s all.”
</p>

<p>
“You are sure it is nothing worse&mdash;quite sure? What a comfort it is
that the Ramons should be here just now! We are not to expect their
sympathy or countenance for our betrothal, I could see that; but I
think Ramon will be quite ready to meet you privately, in any case.
Cyril, do you mind my asking whether you are going to this
entertainment of the consuls’ to-morrow night?”
</p>

<p>
“I was not intending to go, but I will, if you wish.”
</p>

<p>
“No, I don’t. I could not bear to see Ramon put before you. Oh, my
beloved, you don’t know how I long to see you really Prince of
Palestine, unquestionably first on your own soil. I feel quite wicked
on state occasions. I want to go down and take your hand and lead you
up beside me, and say to every one, ‘Yes, he is your king, and mine
too. Don’t dare to offer me any honours that you would refuse to
him!’”
</p>

<p>
“My dear child, actually tears! If you only knew how little I care for
all that sort of thing.”
</p>

<p>
“But I care. I want every one to recognise, as I do, how great you
are. It hurts me when they show me all kinds of honour because I
happen to wear a crown, and leave you in the background, when every
man there ought to be on his knees before you. You pretend not to feel
it, for my sake, but I know you do. It makes me tingle with shame.
When we are married, I shall be only your wife and nothing else, and
no one shall put me before you.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I hope for both our sakes that the Emperor Sigismund will not
pay another visit to Palestine&mdash;during our reign, at any rate.” Cyril
smiled rather unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
“As if I cared for him, or anything he could say! Cyril, I want you to
bring your brother and his family to dine with me to-night, if they
arrive in time. Your relations are to be mine, and I want to know them
all&mdash;the little girl whom Michael loves, and the rest as well. It
shall be purely a family party. I remember your sister-in-law, she had
such a beautiful face, and your brother looked so thoroughly
English&mdash;so reliable. Do you think they will be willing to love me?”
</p>

<p>
“Madame, it doesn’t become your Majesty to fish for compliments. Your
commands shall be obeyed,” and Cyril bowed himself out of her presence
backwards in the orthodox manner.
</p>

<p>
Whether the Queen’s anxiety was real or not, it proved to be wholly
unnecessary. Her guests that evening took her to their hearts with one
accord. She was so beautiful, so gracious, so devoted to Cyril, that,
to use their own expression, Usk and Philippa “simply grovelled” at
her feet from the first moment they saw her. It was no more possible
that she had ill-treated Cyril than that he had ill-treated her, and
Philippa fell back on the theory of a misunderstanding, for which both
might perhaps be slightly to blame, but no more. Her parents took an
equal delight in the reconciliation, for they knew, as Philippa could
not know, the true story of the long waiting-time during which the
Queen’s hair had grown grey, and of the broken engagement which had
made such a grievous blank in her life.
</p>

<p>
After dinner it was decided that the mildness of the season justified
the seeming rashness, and the Queen led her guests out into the
marble-paved courtyard. There was a good deal of happy talk about the
future as they sat under the carved arcades of curious inlaid work,
and watched the fountains springing up among the orange- and
lemon-trees. The rest remembered afterwards that Cyril refused, with
some impatience, to discuss the probability of his obtaining the
governorship of Palestine. It was in the hands of the Powers, he said,
and the less it was talked about the better were his chances. He
changed the subject almost irritably, but there was no other cloud
upon the brightness of the evening. Even Mansfield was happy, although
he was not included in the party. He had been dining with the
household, and now, as he stood leaning against the pillars at the
other end of the courtyard, smoking with M. Stefanovics, he could
feast his eyes upon what seemed to him the most beautiful sight in the
world. The blue and silver wrap which Philippa had thrown about her
had fallen back, and the moonbeams lighted up her crown of golden
curls. Not even the fact of his exclusion from the Queen’s table could
sadden Mansfield, for Philippa had been disappointed about it,
Philippa had said it was a shame, Philippa had refused to see reason
in the matter until she had appealed in vain to her uncle himself.
</p>

<p>
But while at one end of the courtyard Philippa, sitting beside the
Queen, painted glowing pictures of the future, and Mansfield, at the
other, watched her and dreamt delicious dreams, a loud shouting became
audible. The sound came from the street, which was separated from the
inner court by an outer one, occupied by the Queen’s suite and the
servants. Some one was demanding admittance, and with no uncertain
voice. The group under the arcade turned and looked at one another, as
the porter was heard inquiring who the late arrival might be, and
Cyril felt himself growing pale. Was there at hand the announcement of
a new crisis, with which he must again confess his incapacity to deal?
It was not, however, Paschics or the Chevalier, but General Banics,
who appeared at the entrance of the passage leading to the door, and
taking three strides across the courtyard, announced&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“Madame, his Majesty!”
</p>

<p>
“How dare you, Banics? I forbade you to announce me!” cried a voice,
and King Michael, casting a scathing glance at his former tutor,
stepped out into the moonlight after him. “I hope, madame, there is a
welcome for me in this delightful gathering?”
</p>

<p>
The Queen had grasped Cyril’s arm involuntarily as her son entered.
Now she loosed her clutch, but her fingers closed round his as she
stepped forward. “Any reconciliation with me must include him,” was
the announcement conveyed by her attitude, and King Michael read it
aright.
</p>

<p>
“You will not refuse to allow me a share in your happiness, mother? My
sole desire is to stand beside you on this auspicious occasion, and do
honour to your choice. Count, I will tell you frankly that there is no
man I would welcome into my family more heartily than yourself.”
</p>

<p>
“No reason whatever to doubt that statement!” thought Cyril grimly,
while the Queen, her eyes full of tears, raised her son and kissed him
as he stooped to kiss her hand.
</p>

<p>
“This is the crowning point of my happiness, little son,” she
murmured, employing the old tender diminutive.
</p>

<p>
“You have stolen a march upon me, mother,” pursued the King, quite at
his ease. “I hoped to have the honour of presenting the Lady Philippa
to you myself, but you have been before me.” Philippa crimsoned with
indignation as she yielded her finger-tips unwillingly to be kissed.
“My friend Usk, too! And these&mdash;I have no need to ask&mdash;these must be
the honoured parents of the Lady Philippa.”
</p>

<p>
Having saluted Lord and Lady Caerleon with marked distinction, King
Michael took a chair, and signed affably to the rest to be seated. “I
must apologise for appearing in this dress,” he said, looking at his
mother, but including Philippa, as he indicated the undress naval
uniform he was wearing, “but I have had no opportunity of changing my
clothes. I have made no attempt to secure rooms at a hotel, as I hoped
my mother might be able to find a corner for me here. I have only two
or three people with me&mdash;that is all I could bring, since I came as
far as Beyrout on a ship of war.”
</p>

<p>
This explanation was ample for those who knew that the Thracian
sea-going navy consisted of a single gunboat of moderate size, and the
Queen summoned M. Stefanovics and gave him the necessary directions.
The King continued to converse with the greatest affability,
“patronising the whole show,” as Usk complained to Mansfield
afterwards, but the pleasantness of the evening had vanished with his
entrance. That the Queen felt this she showed when she rose as the
signal for her guests to depart. She had meant this family party to be
free from the trammels of Court etiquette, but how could she carry out
her intention when her son made evident in every word and action the
intense condescension with which he was prepared to behave towards her
new relations?

CHAPTER XXII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">THE HISTORY OF AN EVENING.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">I did</span> not expect to see you here to-night, Mr Mansfield.”
</p>

<p>
“I had no idea of coming, madame, but his Excellency insisted upon it.
M. Paschics is here too.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know whether Prince Ramon of Arragon has visited Count
Mortimer yet?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame, this afternoon.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t happen to have heard what he thought of his health?”
</p>

<p>
“No, madame, I did not like to ask; but his Excellency seemed quite
cheerful this evening. When I left the house, he was busy with his
servant, looking over his things, I think.”
</p>

<p>
“I am glad he was in good spirits, but I should like to know exactly.
Might I trouble you to ask Prince Ramon to come and speak to me?”
</p>

<p>
“I am honoured, madame.”
</p>

<p>
In order to welcome the illustrious visitors to Damascus, the
Pannonian, Hercynian, and Thracian consuls had joined forces,
determining to provide an entertainment that should throw into the
shade everything of the kind that had been hitherto attempted in the
city. Strings of bright-coloured lamps, rich draperies, and a
profusion of greenery, had transformed the inner courtyard of the
Pannonian Consulate, which was covered in for the occasion, into a
fairy palace, and the display of dazzling uniforms, Parisian gowns,
and gay national costumes, was not unworthy of its frame. Cyril was
the only person of note at present in Damascus who was not to be seen,
and although the Queen had begged him not to come, she felt vaguely
uneasy at his absence. She welcomed Don Ramon with an anxious smile as
he approached her, not in the best of tempers. Mansfield had disturbed
him in the midst of a deeply interesting conversation. It was the
Prince’s habit to carry his scientific researches even into his hours
of ease, and the sight of a magnificent-looking old Syrian with a
venerable white beard had proved an irresistible temptation. A request
to be allowed to call upon him and take some measurements of his head
had terrified the old man, and it was with the utmost relief that he
took advantage of Mansfield’s approach to break away from this
alarming stranger, quite regardless of his feelings in the matter.
Moreover, like most of the Queen’s relations, Don Ramon had decided to
ignore her intended marriage altogether. Ernestine might disgrace
herself by an alliance with a mere noble if she liked, but her family
were unaware of the existence of any such presumptuous person as her
future husband. The Prince had visited Cyril at her request that
afternoon, not as her <i>fiancé</i>, but as a former valued servant of the
Thracian crown. His outraged family feelings combined at this moment
with his scientific preoccupation to make his manner more than usually
brusque.
</p>

<p>
“You have seen Count Mortimer, cousin?” the Queen asked him timidly.
“I hope your opinion is favourable?”
</p>

<p>
“Favourable, my dear cousin? The man’s case is hopeless!”
</p>

<p>
“Hopeless!” she grasped at a pillar to support herself. “But what is
the matter with him?”
</p>

<p>
“If I describe the injury in technical language you would be no wiser
than before. The brain has ceased to perform one of its functions.”
</p>

<p>
“You mean that he will be&mdash;<i>mad</i>?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no; how you ladies rush at conclusions! There is no trace of
mania whatever. The man is as sane as I am. He has simply lost the
power of connected thought, of planning&mdash;plotting, if you like.”
</p>

<p>
“But how can this be? What has happened to him?”
</p>

<p>
“Over-strain after long and continued fatigue has done the mischief,
by what he says.”
</p>

<p>
“But it is only temporary? Rest will cure him?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear cousin, this is not like the loss of sight or memory which
has taken place as the result of a shock, and may be restored by
another shock. The power is gone. He says that he felt as though
something snapped in his brain, and that will serve very well as a
popular description of what has occurred. The connecting-cord is
broken, and he is incapable of carrying on a train of thought.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, what will he do? what will he do?” moaned the Queen.
</p>

<p>
“Pray do not distress yourself, cousin. Many very worthy persons are
born without the faculty of connected thought, and live happy lives,
unconscious of the defect.”
</p>

<p>
If they were born without it, perhaps. But Cyril, who had possessed
and lost it?
</p>

<p>
“You told him, cousin?”
</p>

<p>
“Naturally. He is not a child. He received the news with the utmost
coolness, and conversed cheerfully as he escorted me to the door. But,
my dear cousin, you are ill&mdash;about to faint. Allow me to call my wife,
or one of your ladies.”
</p>

<p>
“No! no!” Ernestine seized his arm and held him back. “Take me to the
cloakroom, that is all, and fetch Lord or Lady Caerleon. I want no one
else. Don’t let people make a scene.”
</p>

<p>
She sank upon the couch to which he led her, and sat there with
clenched hands and staring eyes until he returned with Philippa, the
only member of the family whom he could find disengaged at the moment.
Receiving another fervent entreaty to say nothing of Ernestine’s
indisposition, he withdrew, and she turned frantically to Philippa.
</p>

<p>
“Will you come with me to your uncle, at once? He has had bad news,
there is something wrong with his brain, and he has been told it too
suddenly. His friends are away, and the shock&mdash;&mdash;” Her voice failed
her, but Philippa read in the piteous eyes the unspoken fear which had
seized herself as she listened, and she grasped the two trembling
hands in her own.
</p>

<p>
“Oh yes, yes; let us come this moment. Usk or Mr Mansfield will help
us.”
</p>

<p>
But Usk was the centre of a group of laughing Greek girls, who were
teaching him to pronounce their language properly, and Mansfield,
having failed to get a word with Philippa all evening, had wandered
away disconsolately with Mr Judson. Even Mr Hicks, engrossed in
subjecting a Latin bishop to an informal interview, was so busy that
Philippa could not catch his eye.
</p>

<p>
“There is only that elderly officer who belongs to your suite, madame,
that I can see,” she said, hurrying back to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
“Banics? Oh, fetch him&mdash;he can be trusted.”
</p>

<p>
Philippa obeyed, and Ernestine addressed the astonished General with
feverish eagerness. “Find us a carriage, Banics. I must go at once to
Count Mortimer’s lodgings&mdash;at once, at once.”
</p>

<p>
“At this hour, madame? Allow me to request his Excellency to wait upon
you instead,” was the sole protest General Banics permitted himself,
but his mistress waved it aside wildly.
</p>

<p>
“You will kill me with all this delay! Find a carriage quickly. I tell
you we must go at once.”
</p>

<p>
He hurried out, and Philippa wrapped the Queen in a dark cloak,
drawing the hood over her head. They stood waiting breathlessly until
General Banics reappeared, having taken forcible possession of the
first carriage he came across. It belonged to a private individual,
but a <i>bakhshish</i> to the servants, added to the awe-inspiring effect
of the General’s uniform and his manner, enabled him to hire it for a
short time, and he helped the ladies in and took his seat upon the box
in disapproving silence. A short drive, during which the Queen and
Philippa held each other’s hands in an agony of fear, brought them to
the Hebrew quarter. To Philippa’s intense relief, although she could
hardly have told why she felt relieved, the door of Cyril’s Jewish
host stood open, and the porter was lounging on the threshold talking
to a friend, so that the commotion usually needed before entrance
could be obtained was not called for. Earlier in the day, Philippa and
her parents had partaken of coffee with the family, in a scene that
might have come straight from the pages of ‘Tancred,’ but now every
one was away at the consuls’ entertainment, with the exception of the
aged grandfather, who was roused from his slumbers by the servants,
and came forth blinking and bewildered. Fortunately he recognised
Philippa, but precious time passed while he lamented the unfitness of
his poor house to receive the exalted young lady, wringing his hands
the while. She cut him short at last in desperation.
</p>

<p>
“I must see my uncle at once, please. It is most important that this
lady should speak to him. No, no; you are not to say that we are
here!”
</p>

<p>
Fairly dashing past the servants, who were already starting off to
announce her presence, she dragged the Queen in the direction of the
staircase which led to Cyril’s rooms on the upper floor, leaving the
old man still wringing his hands and murmuring feebly something about
coffee. No one guessed who the elder woman was who followed Philippa
so closely as she crossed the courtyard, although General Banics
thought it well to station himself at the foot of the staircase, in
case curiosity should be roused as to her identity. Entering the
passage from which the rooms opened, the two ladies were confronted by
the valet Dietrich, who appeared to have been placidly smoking a huge
pipe in the dark.
</p>

<p>
“Where is Count Mortimer, Dietrich? I want to speak to him.” Philippa
lowered her voice involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
“At work, gracious one. He must not be disturbed.”
</p>

<p>
“You know he never meant you were to keep me out. Let me pass,
please.”
</p>

<p>
“Alas, gracious one! I have his Excellency’s orders to admit no one.”
</p>

<p>
“Dietrich!” Ernestine threw back her hood, and the flash of her
diamonds dazzled the valet’s astonished eyes; “you must let me
through. It is a matter of life and death for your master.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon, Majesty, I dare not. I have my orders.”
</p>

<p>
Ernestine clasped her hands wildly. Philippa drew her aside.
</p>

<p>
“Slip round by the verandah while I distract Dietrich’s attention
here,” she whispered hurriedly, and pushing past the servant, almost
succeeded in gaining the door. While he sprang forward to stop her,
the Queen slipped away and ran round to the window. It was open. Cyril
was standing with his back to her, looking narrowly into something
which he was holding up close to his eye.
</p>

<p>
“Cyril!” she shrieked, bursting into the room. He started violently,
but as he turned to her he thrust what he was holding under a piece of
paper lying on the table.
</p>

<p>
“Ernestine! how you startled me! You here&mdash;at this hour? What is the
matter?”
</p>

<p>
“Give it to me! give it to me!” she cried, rushing to the table. As
she had expected, a pistol lay under the paper. Cyril’s hand came upon
hers with a firm grasp as she snatched it up.
</p>

<p>
“No, no, you shall not! Before my eyes, Cyril!” she screamed, trying
to wrest the weapon from him. How it happened she could not tell, but
as she struggled with him there was a sudden explosion, and a bullet
whizzed close to her head, singeing her hair in its passage. Dazed and
deafened, she loosed her hold of the pistol.
</p>

<p>
“There!” she cried, laughing hysterically. “Better me than yourself!”
</p>

<p>
Cyril, with an ashy face, picked up the pistol, which had fallen to
the ground. The door opened impetuously, and Philippa’s horrified face
looked in. Seeing that neither was hurt, she closed the door again,
and meeting General Banics at the top of the stairs, assured him, in a
voice which she vainly tried to render steady, that there was nothing
wrong, A pistol had gone off by accident, that was all.
</p>

<p>
“Are you hurt, Ernestine? How came you here?”
</p>

<p>
“I wish I was hurt! I wish I had been killed!” she cried frantically,
“for then you might have been sorry. Cyril, Cyril, I thought you loved
me, and you don’t.”
</p>

<p>
“You are talking wildly, my dearest.”
</p>

<p>
“You don’t, and there is the proof of it.” She pointed to the
discharged pistol. “It is cruel of you. What have I done that you
should kill yourself to be rid of me?”
</p>

<p>
“Be reasonable, Ernestine. This is an old pistol that I came across in
turning out my things. Am I to blame if it should happen to be loaded?
Accidents with fire-arms are not, absolutely unheard-of events.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, that was what the world was to believe, was it?” She swept him a
superb curtsey. “Many thanks! But it is unnecessary to try to deceive
me. I have spoken to Ramon, I know all. Cyril, my beloved,” her voice
took a tone of the most poignant reproach, “have I deserved this? Am I
such a fair-weather friend that you can’t trust me to cling to you in
trouble as well as in prosperity?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Ernestine, it is because I know you would cling to me that I
decline to drag you down with my wretched self. I thought I should
have a kingdom to offer you; I find I shan’t have even an
independence. Therefore&mdash;&mdash;” he pointed to the pistol.
</p>

<p>
“But you know that I only cared for the kingdom for your sake. Oh,
Cyril, it is you I love, you I want. Your life is mine; you
cannot&mdash;dare not&mdash;rob me of it. Think of the many years you made me
suffer in loneliness. You owe me all those.”
</p>

<p>
He was silent, and she crept closer to him.
</p>

<p>
“Beloved, you don’t regret that I came in? that you have been held
back from taking your life like a coward? I would never have believed
any one who told me that you were afraid to face any future. You will
be greater in adversity than in success. God is sending you this trial
that your true strength may be shown.” Cyril shifted his position
impatiently. “You would not, in a moment of despair, refuse the trial,
fail under the test, and destroy your soul for ever?”
</p>

<p>
“Really, Ernestine, this kind of argument has no weight with me.”
</p>

<p>
“Then perhaps this will weigh with you.” Stung by his tone, she tore
the diamond cross from her neck and held it towards him. “Whatever you
do not believe, you know that God and Heaven and eternal judgment are
realities to me. Understand, then, that if you take your own life,
either to-night or afterwards, I swear that I will do the same,
solemnly believing that my soul will be lost for ever in consequence
of the deed. Oh, what am I saying?” She paused and trembled, but as he
tried to wrest the cross from her, her fingers tightened upon it more
firmly. “Yes, I will do it, without hesitation. God forgive me&mdash;no, I
dare not ask Him to forgive me&mdash;God forgive you, if you drive me to
it.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril dropped into a chair, and buried his face in his hands. She
stood beside him, awaiting his decision with perfect calmness.
</p>

<p>
“If you die, I die,” she said again. At last he looked up.
</p>

<p>
“I give in, Ernestine. But I think you will often repent this
evening’s work.”
</p>

<p>
“Never, even if you do.”
</p>

<p>
“I? I shall repent it every day&mdash;every hour&mdash;of my existence.” It was
the bitter cry of the man who sees every interest and every pleasure
in life snatched from him in a moment. “I am a useless, brainless log,
and you force me to live.”
</p>

<p>
“Dearest, there is still so much that you can do.” The woman’s
unselfishness led her to try to comfort him in his own way, instead of
resenting the little value he set upon her love. “You never even
discovered your loss until a very momentous crisis arose. If Philippa
marries Michael, you can return to Thracia, and become Premier again.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you trying to tempt me to sacrifice poor Phil? Don’t you see that
I could never go back to office as a humdrum, routine, red-tape
Minister, incapable of effecting combinations or making bold strokes?
I could not face a horrible monotony of that sort.”
</p>

<p>
“Then we will settle down in England, near&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“And add another specimen to the British collection of political
failures from the Continent? Hear myself continually pointed out as an
awful warning of the dangers of leaving the beaten track? Never!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, then, we will go back to Sitt Zeynab. You shall reign there in
peace, and no one can come near you against your will. Wherever you
are, there I shall be happy.”
</p>

<p>
“My poor Ernestine, I am not worth it. You had better let me die,
dear.” His eyes sought the pistol longingly. “I am a miserable, broken
wretch, with no hope and no contentment left, and I shall lead you a
terrible life.”
</p>

<p>
“No life with you could be terrible to me. To be near you is joy
enough. It was not your success I loved, it was you, and you are the
same still. I love you, Cyril, I love you.”
</p>

<p>
The passion of the tone, the eyes shining into his, the trembling
hands laid upon his shoulders, stirred Cyril with a stronger emotion
than he had ever known, and words came to his lips,&mdash;echoes, perhaps,
of others heard long before in his childhood&mdash;he knew not how or
whence.
</p>

<p>
“God do so to me and more also, Ernestine, if I ever forget what you
have done for me to-night. Dearest, you understand. Some women would
have upbraided me for despising their love, but you are not like that.
And you will have your reward. Politics will never again separate me
from you, at any rate.” He kissed her gently on the forehead, and
wrapped her cloak round her. “You must go back, dear, or you will be
missed. A curious little interlude in the evening’s entertainment,
isn’t it? Well, your coming here has saved me, such as I am.”
</p>

<p>
Ernestine choked down her sobs as she clung to him. “You will live
because I want you,” she said. “Perhaps you can’t rule the world,
beloved, but you can make one woman very happy. You have done it
already, and she is grateful.”
</p>

<p>
She went out, and found Philippa waiting anxiously in the passage.
</p>

<p>
“It’s all right, Phil. We have saved him,” she said, holding the
girl’s hand tightly in hers as they passed down the steps and across
the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
“But what had happened to him?” asked Philippa breathlessly, when they
were in the carriage again.
</p>

<p>
“Something has given way in his brain. He will never be able to plan
again.”
</p>

<p>
“He can’t plan? Oh, poor Uncle Cyril!” cried Philippa, appalled.
</p>

<p>
“Phil, you must help me to keep it a secret&mdash;at any rate until after
we are married. I know they will part me from him if they can. Once I
am his wife I don’t care what happens. Only his real friends must know
of this terrible trouble, such as your father and the Chevalier
Goldberg. And we must keep Michael in a good temper. My child, you see
why he has come here? His manner in addressing you last night showed
that sufficiently. Is there any hope for him? You know how I should
rejoice to welcome you as a daughter.”
</p>

<p>
“I would do anything else in the world for you and Uncle Cyril,” burst
from Philippa, “but not that. I don’t love him in the least. I don’t
even&mdash;like him,” she was about to say, but changed it, feebly enough,
into&mdash;“care for him.”
</p>

<p>
“It is not your fault, Phil. I ought to be the first person to know
that love is not at one’s own command. But oh, dear child, if you
could abstain from refusing him until after the wedding is over! I
don’t mean that you should deceive him, of course, but if only you
could prevent his proposing to you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll do what I can,” said Philippa doubtfully, but she felt that if
King Michael had determined to propose to her, it was probable that he
would do so, in spite of any obstacles she might put in his way. That
this intuition of hers was a correct one she discovered as soon as she
re-entered the assembly-room with the Queen. Her father was standing
not far from the cloakroom door, and stepped forward to meet her.
</p>

<p>
“Why, Phil, I have been looking for you everywhere! I could not think
what had become of you until the Prince of Arragon told me that he had
left you with her Majesty.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I was seized with a sudden faintness, and Philippa was kind
enough to remain with me until I felt better,” said Ernestine
graciously, bestowing one of her rare smiles on Philippa as she turned
towards the Thracian consul, who was anxious to present a relative to
her.
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” said Lord Caerleon, taking his daughter aside, “the King has
been speaking to me about you.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, father!” exclaimed Philippa, in dismay.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose I ought to feel honoured,” continued her father ruefully,
“but that youth riles me&mdash;there’s no other word for it. He asked to be
allowed to visit me to-morrow at the hotel, graciously intimating that
he considered me as in a sort of way a brother monarch, and therefore
felt able to dispense with strict etiquette. I guessed what he wanted,
and thought we might just as well settle matters without getting your
name mixed up with his, so I said I couldn’t think of giving him the
trouble. Thereupon he did you the honour to request me in so many
words to regard him as a suitor for your hand, this being merely
preliminary, as he explained, to a formal proposal through the proper
channels. I said I hadn’t had any conversation with you lately on such
subjects, but judging from the sentiments you expressed on the last
occasion, I couldn’t give him any hope. Upon that he informed me that
I wasn’t up to date. He is now a reformed character, father of his
country and so on, the condescending patron of everything that’s good.
I don’t want to laugh at any man’s reformation, Phil, but the fellow
takes himself too seriously. I told him I didn’t see that it was much
good bothering you about the matter, and he became very high and
mighty indeed. He reminded me that young ladies did not receive offers
of marriage from crowned heads every day, and intimated that such an
honour ought to be accepted in a proper spirit. In other words, he
warns you not to reject his offer without due consideration. I am
telling you about it because he insisted I should, and I thought he
might turn rusty and make some unpleasantness if I didn’t, but having
laid the proposal before you, I can now go with a good conscience and
tell him you refuse it.”
</p>

<p>
“Wait, father, please!” cried Philippa, in an uncertain voice. “I&mdash;I
think I will take time to consider.”
</p>

<p>
Her father turned and gazed at her. “Phil!” he said, with more sorrow
and disappointment in his voice than she had ever heard in it before.
</p>

<p>
“I think it’s only proper, as he says,” went on Philippa, with a laugh
that was a little hysterical. Don’t you, father? I&mdash;I should not like
to be too hasty.
</p>

<p>
“Phil, I wouldn’t insult you by imagining that you could be induced to
marry a man you didn’t love for the sake of a crown, but what in the
world are you driving at? You needn’t think anything of what I said
just now about the fellow’s making himself unpleasant to your uncle
and the Queen, for what harm could he do, after all?” Philippa
shuddered. Her father did not know what terrible harm King Michael
might do if he chose. “But at any rate, don’t give him a moral claim
upon you in this way. It’s quite unnecessary to be so tender of his
feelings.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh no, no moral claim,” said Philippa entreatingly. “You can tell him
you are perfectly certain that delay will make no change in my
feelings, but that if he wishes it, I will consent not to give him a
final answer until the day after the wedding. It’s&mdash;it’s due to his
position, father.” She laughed again. “I’m sure you can make him see
it in that light.”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t make you out, Phil,” said Lord Caerleon doubtfully, as he
left her. Presently he returned, pulling at his moustache in a way
that showed him to be still puzzled.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Phil, I have given him your message, and he accepts it as
merely his due. I can swear I’ve done my best to choke him off, but he
won’t have it. I think he understands that he’s not to come hanging
about the hotel, setting people talking, but he may do what he can,
without making you conspicuous, to prepossess you in his favour&mdash;in
conversation and so on. He seems very well satisfied, and I hope you
are. I wish with all my heart you were safely engaged to&mdash;er&mdash;some
other fellow.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you determining to turn me out of doors if I accept King Michael,
father? Don’t you think your way of receiving a king as a would-be
son-in-law is just a little&mdash;original?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, Phil?” cried her father in distress, catching sight at last of
the tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, father, I’m so miserable&mdash;so frightened&mdash;I don’t know what to
do!” and Philippa laid her golden head on his shoulder, and sobbed
there comfortably, as if she had gone back ten years, and been a
little girl again.
</p>

<p>
“Do you want me to get rid of the fellow for you, Phil? I’ll do it
like a shot. King or no king, I won’t have him making you cry with his
silly nonsense.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, it’s not that. Lend me your handkerchief, father dear. This
lace thing is no good. Don’t you think mother would come home now?”
</p>

<p>
“I’m sure she would. I’ll go and ask her,” and poor Lord Caerleon went
away thoroughly puzzled. Hitherto nothing had ever interrupted the
perfect understanding between Philippa and himself, but now he was
realising miserably that his little daughter had become a woman, and
Lord Caerleon had always confessed that he did not understand women.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
“Mansfield,” said Usk abruptly, when he and his friend were leaving
the Consulate in company a little later, “that idiot is after Philippa
again.”
</p>

<p>
“What, that Thracian beast?” Mansfield’s language was far from choice,
but he was not without provocation. “Well, your father will soon kick
him out.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s what I thought, but there’s no chance of that now. She has
taken time to consider her answer, and we know what that means. I
thought I’d tell you myself, before&mdash;before you could hear it from any
one else.” Mansfield gasped, and Usk went on hurriedly, “I wouldn’t
have believed it, but the fellow told me himself. Perhaps it’s a lie.”
</p>

<p>
“No fear!” was the sternly hopeless answer. “What would be the good,
when a word with your father would put you right at once? She has been
over-persuaded.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I know how it is. He has got round her with the notion that it’s
her duty to sacrifice herself to him for the sake of his rotten
kingdom, like a girl in a book. I’m awfully sorry, Mansfield&mdash;sick,
too.”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield answered only by an inarticulate grunt.
</p>

<p>
“I wouldn’t have believed Phil was such an owl,” went on her brother.
“Every one knows that sort of arrangement is bound to end in an awful
smash. But never say die, old man; she may chuck him yet.”
</p>

<p>
“Not she,” returned Mansfield, with a fixed despair.
</p>


<h3 id="ch23">
CHAPTER XXIII.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">MAN AND WIFE.</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">This</span> is the irony of fate!” said Mansfield to himself the next
morning. The English mail had come in, and the city postman, going his
leisurely rounds on his white donkey, was engaged in distributing the
letters it brought. A few minutes before, he had placed in Mansfield’s
hands that which should have been his passport to paradise. The Right
Honourable Geoffrey Forfar wrote to say that one of his secretaries
had accepted an appointment under Government, and he had much pleasure
in fulfilling his promise with regard to the vacant post. Would
Mansfield kindly arrange to take up his new duties as soon as his
present employer could spare him?
</p>

<p>
Mr Forfar would have been surprised to learn that his kindly letter
served but to inflict on its recipient torments worse than those of
Tantalus. If the offer had only arrived yesterday, Mansfield reflected
bitterly, he might have spoken to Philippa in time to forestall her
royal suitor&mdash;but no, it did not turn up until Philippa was beyond his
reach. That was how things always happened, he assured himself, for
misfortune was developing in him the usual touch of cynicism. For a
short time he had visions of accepting the post and returning to
England forthwith, throwing himself into his new work with an ardour
that carried all before it. He saw himself entering the House, backed
by Mr Forfar’s influence and the prestige of his own reputation as a
man with an unusual and practical knowledge of European politics, saw
himself, equally famous as a thinker and a debater, accepting office
and rising to giddy heights of power&mdash;and this was all undertaken for
the sake of convincing the faithless Philippa that the true lover whom
she had cast off to obtain a throne would have been able to give her
something more than the love she despised. Unfortunately for
Mansfield’s political future, his heart took fright instantly at the
idea of leaving Syria while Philippa remained there. He must be on the
spot, even if it was only to witness the complete destruction of his
hopes. It is possible, also, that those hopes were not yet quite so
absolutely dead as he imagined.
</p>

<p>
“I won’t answer this at once,” he said, thrusting the letter into his
pocket, and turned to some notes which he was to write out for Cyril.
He had scarcely sat down when he was interrupted by the Chevalier, who
emerged from the inner room in a state of wild disorder. When he had
asked to see Cyril, Mansfield had observed that he appeared to be
labouring under great emotion, but now he seemed to have been tearing
both his hair and his clothes. He dropped into a chair opposite
Mansfield, and smote his forehead with his hands.
</p>

<p>
“De finest brain in Europe, and de stronk defence off Zion!” he
murmured.
</p>

<p>
“I beg your pardon?” said Mansfield, astonished.
</p>

<p>
“You do not know? you hef not heard? All we hef done iss in fain, and
Israel may return to deir keptifity to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
“What has gone wrong?” Mansfield asked the question with great
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
“Your master can plen no more; his brain iss inchured. And we, wid our
scheme on de point of fulfilment, are left desolate.”
</p>

<p>
“That break-down the other day!” cried Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, det must hef been de first menifestation off de melady. Ach,
Mortimer, my frient, I could always trust in you! While you lifed,
Zion was safe. And now you life still, but your mind iss dead. No,
no,” as Mansfield started up frantically, “dere iss no medness. He can
do eferythink but plen, but so can all de rest. Our head iss gone.”
</p>

<p>
“And now that he can’t help you, you care no more about him?”
</p>

<p>
“Hef I gifen you reasson to say det?” asked the Chevalier, with real
dignity. “Because I lament my country in peril, must I hef lost sight
off my frient? It iss de Queen det hess told me de frightful noose.
Ah, dere iss a woman! de Count hess much left still since he hess her.
She dessired to point out to me de risk. You see it? Efery nation and
efery statesman hess somethink against him. He hess played dem all off
against one anoder, and only his wits hef safed him again and again.
Now he iss powerless, and when dey find it out, dey will come about
him like birds off prey. A week ago de influence off de Syndicate,
exerted through me, would hef presserfed him from all annoyance, but
now de Syndicate iss split in two. Until we discofer how far de
disaffection extends, I dare not trust efen my broders. Your master
must not remain here, nor would he be safe in Europe&mdash;efen in America.
De Queen propoces det immediately upon deir merrich dey shell go to
dis estate off hers in de desert, where dey will be in safety until
efents hef defeloped demselfs. We shell soon see what frients he hess
left. I need not ask wheder you are true. Do me de fafour to beliefe
det I am so also, efen dough my nation hess profed ungrateful to its
benefector.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry,” said Mansfield. “I had no business to say what I did.”
</p>

<p>
“Det iss well. Trust me, and help me to do what I can for him, det iss
all I ask.”
</p>

<p>
He went away, and Mansfield took Mr Forfar’s letter out of his pocket
again. “This settles it!” he said, and sitting down at the table,
dashed off a grateful refusal of the Prime Minister’s offer. As soon
as it was finished, he went out and posted it.
</p>

<p>
Having thus burnt his boats and cut himself off from every hope of
Philippa, he felt that he had done all that could be expected of him,
and owed himself a reward. It is needless to say that the reward took
the shape of a sight of Philippa, and when he had dutifully attended
Cyril to the Queen’s house in the afternoon, he betook himself
forthwith to the Caerleons’ rooms in Spyridion’s hotel, where he was
able to watch Philippa pouring out tea, and to luxuriate in absolute
misery. The excitement of the night before had left Philippa white and
tired, and her hand shook as she lifted the teapot, but Mansfield
decided that her exhaustion was due to the mental struggle she must
have undergone before she could bring herself to contemplate marrying
King Michael, and he steeled his heart against her. Her father
attributed her obvious unhappiness to a very different cause, and when
Mansfield took his leave he walked a little way with him.
</p>

<p>
“I suppose you heard nothing from Forfar by the mail, Mansfield?” he
asked. “I saw him just before we left England, and he hinted that
Jowell would probably go to the India Office, so that he would soon
need a new assistant secretary.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I heard from him,” replied Mansfield, his heart beginning to
beat with uncomfortable speed, “and he offered me the post. But I
refused it.”
</p>

<p>
“Refused it!” cried Lord Caerleon, with unconcealed dismay.
</p>

<p>
“You see,” Mansfield went on, “I&mdash;I felt there was no particular
reason why I should go back to England,” he looked straight at his
companion, “and it would take a great deal to make me leave Count
Mortimer in the present state of his affairs.”
</p>

<p>
“But come, Mansfield&mdash;I have a right to ask, after what you said to me
early in the year&mdash;have you changed your mind?”
</p>

<p>
“How dare you&mdash;&mdash;” began Mansfield furiously, then his tone altered.
“I beg your pardon, I’m a sulky brute; but&mdash;well, imagine that you
were in my place, Lord Caerleon, forbidden to speak to Lady Phil, and
then finding that another fellow had stepped in and cut you out.”
</p>

<p>
“But he has not cut you out. We are all on your side. Phil’s only
reason for taking time to consider her answer is that she may not hurt
the King’s feelings. I am certain she doesn’t care a rap for him.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, at any rate, I’m not such a cad as to cut in and spoil the
other fellow’s game,” and Mansfield marched on with an air of superior
virtue which Lord Caerleon found extremely irritating. He could not
well say that he particularly wished to see the very thing done which
Mansfield regarded with such righteous disapprobation, but he felt
that he was being treated with scant justice. True, he had banished
Mansfield originally for his own good&mdash;here he stopped; was it not
rather because he did not want to lose his daughter? Still, it was not
his fault that this second suitor had appeared, and nothing had been
farther from his thoughts than to drive Philippa into a loveless
marriage by separating her from the man whom he now suspected that she
liked. It was hard to throw the onus of rejecting the King’s suit
entirely on Philippa and himself, and things would have been much
simpler if it could have been refused on the ground that she was
already engaged to some one else. However, since Mansfield chose to
consider that he had been ill-used, and could hardly be commanded to
propose to Philippa against his will, the plan was not practicable.
</p>

<p>
Lord Caerleon made no further attempt to alter the course of events,
and Mansfield, grimly resolute, continued to torment himself with the
sight of Philippa and her royal suitor. King Michael was following
Prince Mirkovics’ advice, and endeavouring to enlist Philippa’s sense
of duty upon his side. Since his <i>coup d’état</i> of the summer, he had
developed an abnormal interest in affairs of State, and he recounted
his plans, hopes, fears, failures, successes, and aspirations to
Philippa at suitable length. The recital bored her extremely, but she
would not have been her mother’s daughter if she could have brought
herself to throw cold water on any man’s good intentions, and she
honestly did her best to sympathise with the King. Her task was not
made easier by Usk, who continued to regard his would-be
brother-in-law with unmitigated aversion. King Michael sought his
acquaintance in the most flattering way, and extended the same honour
to Mansfield and Mr Judson, never perceiving that his gracious
determination to put people at their ease had the invariable effect of
making them uncomfortable. The three Cambridge men were quite ready to
overlook his position, which was, after all, not his own fault; but he
could not forget it, and the consequence was that the friendship
languished, and that among themselves they accused him of “putting on
side,” and stigmatised him as “wretchedly bad form.” It is true that
Usk once expressed in private a wish that the King was his brother;
but only, as he explained immediately, that he might feel justified in
punching his head.
</p>

<p>
While Philippa’s affairs were in this unsettled state, the time of her
uncle’s marriage was rapidly approaching. The wedding had been fixed
for New Year’s day, and it had been the secret design of the Chevalier
and his party that after the ceremony a deputation from the Jewish
provisional government should wait upon the newly married pair and
offer them the crown, if such it might be called, of Palestine. But
this was now recognised to be out of the question. When the sensation
caused by the appearance of the Yellow Pamphlet, and the subsequent
repudiation of Cyril by half the Jewish world, had a little subsided,
the journalists of the Continent held their breath for a time,
realising what they had done. The man whom they had helped to vilify
had never been known to forgive an insult, and the issue of that
<i>brutum fulmen</i>, the message framed by Mr Hicks and Paschics in order
to gain time, threw them into a state approaching panic. What blow had
Count Mortimer in preparation?
</p>

<p>
But as the days passed on and still nothing happened, a sensation of
relief diffused itself visibly among Cyril’s opponents, while his
supporters became correspondingly dejected. Presently a brief message
from the Emperor of Pannonia, forwarded through the Chevalier’s
confidential agent in Vindobona, put the question in a nutshell. What
measures did Count Mortimer mean to take in order to re-establish his
predominant influence in the counsels of the Syndicate? Whether the
charges brought against him in the Yellow Pamphlet were true or false
did not signify in the least; but unless the Jews were unanimous in
preferring him to any other ruler, the Emperor could go no further in
recommending his selection by the Powers. While the question of the
answer to be returned to this intimation was being discussed between
Cyril and the Chevalier&mdash;the one in a frenzy of alarm and indecision,
the other in an agony of helplessness&mdash;the matter was taken out of
their hands. It became known throughout Europe that Count Mortimer’s
brain was affected, and that he was no longer to be feared.
</p>

<p>
How the jealously guarded secret had leaked out could not at first be
discovered, but the report was afterwards traced to Don Ramon of
Arragon’s assistant, who had access to his case-books. He had been a
student of the University of Vindobona, and was therefore almost
inevitably an anti-Semite, and he had shared his discovery with
Colonel Czartoriski, with whom he had come in contact at Damascus.
Acting upon instructions from his mistress, Colonel Czartoriski
communicated the news to the press, and Anti-Semitism all over the
Continent went mad with joy. Nor were the professed enemies of Zion
alone in their exultation, for the Government papers (those of
Pannonia and Thracia alone excepted) took up the slanderous tale in
language equally bitter, if slightly more decorous. The man who had
known how to impose his will on Europe was helpless&mdash;might be knocked
down and jumped upon, metaphorically speaking&mdash;and there was no lack
of moralists to improve the occasion. The vilest calumnies, the most
outrageous accusations, were gravely detailed as matters of fact, the
attacks growing bolder as each historian, finding that the victim made
no sign, strove to outdo his neighbour. The statesmen who had smarted
under Cyril’s yoke added their quota of titbits of confidential
information, to be duly worked up by the fortunate journalist to whom
they were whispered, the result being generally a fable that
astonished no one more than the original narrator himself. In short,
the only wonder was that the political world could have been so long
held in subjection by a charlatan so abjectly worthless and
contemptible as Count Mortimer was shown to be.
</p>

<p>
But while the storm was raging in Europe, and its echoes reached with
painful distinctness the ears of the little group of friends at
Damascus, there reached them also an intimation that behind all the
sound and fury there was a purpose that signified something. On the
morning of the 28th of December, General Banics paid an early visit,
first to Lord Caerleon and then to the Chevalier, bringing an urgent
request from Queen Ernestine that they would come to her at once.
Apprehensive of danger, they lost no time in complying, and as they
were ushered into the Queen’s presence, Ernestine came forward to meet
them in her impulsive way, holding out her hands.
</p>

<p>
“I have sent for you,” she said, “because you are dear and faithful
friends of mine, and I can trust you to help me in the frightful
danger which is threatening the man we all love. You will not let them
separate me from him?”
</p>

<p>
“Nefer, unless it iss your Machesty’s own dessire,” said the
Chevalier.
</p>

<p>
“But we know that nothing could be further from the Queen’s wishes,”
said Lord Caerleon indignantly. “Command us, madame, for anything that
we can do.”
</p>

<p>
“I knew I could rely upon you both.” She cast an encouraging glance at
the discomfited Chevalier. “Then please sit down, and let me tell you
what I have heard this morning from my dear old friend Princess
Soudaroff. She says she was afraid to telegraph, lest the message
should be stopped or the enemy discover that we had been warned, but
she writes in the greatest anxiety and haste. She is at present in
Paris, and her brother-in-law, Prince Soudaroff, had just paid her a
flying visit when she wrote. Naturally, as she says, they discussed
Count Mortimer’s misfortunes, and something that Prince Soudaroff let
fall gave her the idea that a plot was preparing against him. She
questioned him closely, and though he evaded her inquiries with the
most consummate skill, she is convinced that the Emperor Sigismund and
my own family are taking measures to prevent our marriage. What roused
her suspicions was a remark which escaped Prince Soudaroff about a
Hercynian ship of war suddenly ordered to the Levant, and she suggests
that they will attempt to kidnap the Count before New Year’s Day, and
convey him to some place of confinement on the plea that he is mad.
They will act in my interests, to save me from such an unfortunate
marriage, you see! But I won’t be saved from it. How shall we
checkmate them?”
</p>

<p>
“Madame,” said the Chevalier, as she paused abruptly, her eyes bright
and her cheeks flushed, “de Goldberg millions hef profed demselfs off
little afail lately, but at least dey will suffice to buy de gerrison
off Damascus for a week. Efery men in it shell be your serfant, and
guard de Count.”
</p>

<p>
“But is such a measure advisable?” asked Lord Caerleon. “The other
side can out-bribe us, and bring diplomatic pressure to bear as well.
How would you like to steal a march on them, madame? You are not
inclined to set an inordinate value upon wedding-dresses and
festivities?”
</p>

<p>
“In comparison with the bridegroom?” Ernestine smiled. “No, indeed. If
it had not been for the wishes of my son and my faithful servants, I
would have chosen the quietest wedding possible.”
</p>

<p>
“Under the circumstances, madame, his Majesty and your ladies will no
doubt waive their natural wishes. The time required by law for
publishing the notice of the intended marriage at the British
Consulate expires to-day. To-morrow, then&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“I see,” said the Queen, blushing brightly.
</p>

<p>
“His Excellency Count Mortimer, madame,” said General Banics,
presenting himself at the door, and Cyril entered the room, his
unexpected appearance making the three conspirators look highly
confused.
</p>

<p>
“What are you plotting against me?” he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know that you have not wished me good morning?” asked
Ernestine, rising. “Our friends will excuse us for a moment, I know,”
and she made him a sign to follow her out into the verandah. After a
few minutes they returned, Ernestine flushed and smiling, with her
hand in his.
</p>

<p>
“Caerleon, Chevalier,” said Cyril, “you have heard of the new danger
that threatens me, and you know that the Queen”&mdash;he raised her hand to
his lips&mdash;“would not refuse to share it. But to avoid complications,
and to forestall the enemy, she has consented to allow our marriage to
take place to-morrow instead of New Year’s Day.”
</p>

<p>
“A good idea. Very sensible and prudent,” said Lord Caerleon heartily,
admiring the delicate tact with which Ernestine had contrived to make
the suggestion come from Cyril instead of herself. “We had decided
that it would be better for the marriage to take place at the
Consulate in any case, so that it will make no difference.”
</p>

<p>
“I understand that Mr Judson can perform the service at the
Consulate,” said the Queen quickly. “I should not like a purely civil
marriage.”
</p>

<p>
“Det iss all right,” said the Chevalier. “I hef talked to Colonel
Monckton a great deal about de metter. De merrich can take place et de
Consulate in his pressence, and nothink more will be wanted.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps,” said Lord Caerleon to his brother, rather doubtfully, “it
might be as well if you left for the desert immediately after the
ceremony. If there is any idea of kidnapping you, they might still
carry you off, and set the lawyers to work to declare the marriage
invalid.”
</p>

<p>
“We will leave Damascus as soon as the ceremony is performed,” said
the Queen calmly. “When we are together and out of their reach they
can do nothing against us. The Emperor Sigismund has no jurisdiction
over me, and no court in the world would deny that Count Mortimer, an
Englishman born, could be legally married at a British Consulate. On
his side the marriage must stand, and if they declare it invalid on
mine&mdash;well, we will be married over and over again until they are
content to allow it to stand. But there must not be the slightest
suspicion of any flaw. You will see to that, messieurs?” She looked at
the three men.
</p>

<p>
“There shall be none,” responded Lord Caerleon.
</p>

<p>
“It will be better,” said Cyril, “to tell no one but Monckton of our
change of plan until the morning. With the best intentions in the
world, Phil and the young fellows could not help letting it be seen
that they had an important secret in charge, and the least slip might
ruin us. I suppose, Chevalier,”&mdash;he was fingering absently Princess
Soudaroff’s letter, which the Queen had asked him to read,&mdash;“it has
occurred to you that Vladimir Alexandrovitch had some object in giving
away his fellow-conspirators like this?”
</p>

<p>
“You mean det he intended to let you hef a hint to escape, Count?”
</p>

<p>
“Not necessarily. I think he has some other plan on hand&mdash;more
important to him, though not to the Emperor Sigismund&mdash;and he has
deliberately sacrificed his ally in order to divert your attention
from his own game.”
</p>

<p>
“But what iss det?” cried the Chevalier distractedly.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, that you must not ask me. I could have told you once, I don’t
doubt, but now”&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders. “Think it out if you can,
Chevalier.”
</p>

<p>
“It iss hopeless, Count. I gif it up. My aim now iss to see you safely
merried to her Machesty, and I can think of nothink else.”
</p>

<p>
The three conspirators took their leave of the Queen, and departed to
put things in train for the next day’s ceremony. Lord Caerleon paid a
visit to Colonel Monckton, the British Consul, and bespoke his consent
to the change of date and his assistance in the necessary
arrangements. Cyril sent Paschics to look for Yeshua (the blind man
had returned to Damascus with the Queen and her escort), who was to
find his way to the sheikh of the Beni Ismail, and tell him that he
and his tribe would be needed to guard their sovereign and her husband
to Sitt Zeynab two days earlier than the time agreed upon. The
Chevalier, on his side, devised a little plan of his own for
hoodwinking the enemy, and having laid his train, devoted his
attention to procuring the tents and supplies for the journey.
</p>

<p>
The next morning there was a kind of informal reception at the British
Consulate. The Chevalier took Mr Judson there to make final
arrangements with the Consul, and Lady Caerleon looked in to have a
talk with Mrs Monckton. Paschics appeared with a document which needed
signing, and an unfortunate accident led to the invasion of the house
by several other and more important guests. The Queen and her son,
with General Banics and M. Stefanovics in attendance, were going out
for a ride with Lord Caerleon, Philippa, and Usk, but just outside the
Consulate the Queen’s horse cast a shoe. It was only natural that her
Majesty and her companions should be invited into the house for a few
minutes; but it was certainly strange that Baroness von Hilfenstein,
Madame Stefanovics, and Fräulein von Staubach should have chosen that
particular time for calling upon Mrs Monckton in a body. Possibly,
however, they felt the need of some distraction after the shock they
had received when their mistress informed them that the exquisite
creation in grey and silver, fresh from a Parisian <i>atelier</i>, which
had arrived that morning, would not be worn on New Year’s day.
Curiously enough (Philippa said afterwards that the array of
coincidences in connection with this wedding surpassed those
associated with the name of Mr Wemmick), Cyril invited Mansfield to
take a stroll with him as far as the Consulate just at this time.
</p>

<p>
“What’s this I hear about you from my brother, Mansfield?” he asked,
as they started; “that you have refused Forfar’s post?”
</p>

<p>
“I prefer to stay with you, Count. I don’t want to change.”
</p>

<p>
“But you can’t stay with me. Do you know where you are going at this
moment? You are going to see me married, which means that we must
part.”
</p>

<p>
“But, Count&mdash;&mdash;” gasped Mansfield, in dire dismay.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t wish to be unkind, but doesn’t it strike you that you would
be just a little <i>de trop</i> on the honeymoon trip? And really, you
know, it would be a perfect farce for me to drag two secretaries about
with me now.”
</p>

<p>
“And you mean to keep Paschics, and kick me out?”
</p>

<p>
“My dear Mansfield, don’t look at me as if I had pierced your young
heart to its depths. Paschics must stay with me. He has worked under
me more than twenty years, and asks nothing better than to go on as he
has done. It would be sheer cruelty to send him adrift at his age. But
you have your life before you, and I am not going to see you stranded
in the desert with me or any one else.”
</p>

<p>
“You are not treating me well,” said Mansfield hoarsely. “I have not
deserved to be turned off at a moment’s notice like this. You do it
because you know how I&mdash;how fond&mdash;how much I think of you, and you
feel that you can treat me like a dog.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s right. Your way of taking it relieves me infinitely. Do you
know that your precipitate refusal of Forfar’s offer has given me a
great deal of trouble&mdash;most inconsiderate of you to bother a man in
this way just on the eve of his wedding. The Chevalier and I have put
our heads together, and he has found a berth for you&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Hang the Chevalier!” cried Mansfield. Cyril went on, unmoved.
</p>

<p>
“He wants an Englishman to act as his agent in superintending his
various model farms and gardens in Palestine. He doesn’t expect you to
see that he isn’t cheated, for that would be hopeless; but he thinks
you are capable of discovering whether the work is done or not, which
seems to be rather a moot question at present. It will be a life after
your own heart, with plenty of riding about. You will choose a spot
that suits you and build your house, and in a year or so I haven’t a
doubt you will bring a wife to inhabit it.”
</p>

<p>
“Why you should say that, I don’t know. You know as well as I do&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” for Mansfield faltered.
</p>

<p>
“That Lady Phil will marry King Michael.”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you think you are taking things a little too much for granted?”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know. I don’t care, anyhow. It seems I have to lose
everything I care about&mdash;first Lady Phil, then you.”
</p>

<p>
Cyril made no answer. Perhaps he had no comfort to offer; perhaps no
time to offer it. They were entering the Consulate, and Mr Hicks, who
was lounging in the doorway, greeted them with portentous solemnity
and an almost imperceptible wink. The guests who had assembled in such
a casual way were gathered in one of the larger rooms, and Mr Judson,
wearing his surplice, was in readiness. Often as most of those present
had pictured this wedding to themselves, they had never anticipated
anything like the real scene&mdash;the large bare room, hastily decorated
with a collection of European nicknacks and Oriental draperies
gathered from all corners of the house, the bride wearing her
riding-habit and the bridegroom a tweed suit, and the motley
assemblage of spectators, in which King Michael stood side by side
with the Chevalier Goldberg, and the American journalist rubbed
shoulders with the Thracian Court officials. It was only fitting that
the pair whose history had at so many points touched that of the
Hebrew race should be united by the son of a Jewish convert; but the
irony of the occasion found its climax in the fact that the woman who
had risked so much in defence of the forms of her religion should be
debarred not only from the services of a clergyman of her own church,
but even from the use of a consecrated building, and should bear the
deprivation without a murmur.
</p>

<p>
In an incredibly short space of time the service which seemed so brief
and meant so much was over, and Cyril and his wife were receiving the
congratulations of the rest. There was small scope for oratory in the
farewells. Mansfield’s sore heart was a little comforted by the grip
of Cyril’s hand as he passed him in the doorway, even though the
accompanying words were merely, “Don’t be a silly fool!” Another horse
had been brought round for the Queen’s use, and the riding-party made
a fresh start; but this time it included Cyril. Paschics and Dietrich
were to join their master outside the city, convoying Fräulein von
Staubach, who insisted upon her right to attend the Queen now that her
turn had come round. The men took off their hats as the party rode
away, but turned immediately to rebuke the ladies for shedding tears.
Such a display of pocket-handkerchiefs was calculated to attract
undesirable attention, they said, and Baroness von Hilfenstein and
Madame Stefanovics retreated into the inmost recesses of the house, to
guard against endangering the Queen’s safety by their uncontrollable
emotion. But the fugitives rode safely through the city and out at the
gate, meeting the sheikh as had been arranged, without being
challenged by a single official.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
That evening the yacht White Lady, lying in Beyrout roadstead,
suddenly hoisted English colours and the Thracian royal standard, and
put to sea, in company with the Thracian gunboat St Gabriel. It was
remarked as peculiar by curious observers on shore that the Hercynian
war-ship which had arrived that morning immediately slipped her cable
and followed them.
</p>

CHAPTER XXIV.<br/>
<span class="chap_sub">“THE BITTER CLOSE OF ALL.”</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
“<span class="sc">Phil</span>, I want a word or two with you.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m so glad, father. I’ve been longing for a talk. Let us come up to
the roof.”
</p>

<p>
They mounted to the marble terrace, shaded by orange-trees in pots,
and Lord Caerleon began to pull off withered leaves as busily as if he
had had no other intention in coming. Suddenly he turned to his
daughter, who sat watching him patiently, the usual sparkle of fun
missing from her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Phil, the King wants your answer. You promised he should have it the
day after the wedding, and that is to-day.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t think he ought to take a mean advantage of your having put
the wedding forward two days, do you, father? But perhaps it’s as well
to get it over.”
</p>

<p>
“I&mdash;I hope you’ve thought what you’re doing, Phil?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, it hasn’t needed very much thought. I have known all along what
I should say.”
</p>

<p>
“Phil,” Lord Caerleon spoke with tremendous energy, “I am awfully
anxious about you. It’s not that I distrust your common-sense, for you
are old enough to judge for yourself, nor that I suspect you for a
moment of intending to marry for the sake of a crown. But I was
talking things over with your mother last night, and she is very much
cut up&mdash;afraid that your sense of duty will lead you to accept the
King. I don’t want to bias you unfairly&mdash;we have always prided
ourselves on leaving you as free as possible&mdash;but you may not have
thought what such a marriage would involve. I have tested the delights
of royalty, you know, and I felt that I could not stand it alone. With
your mother to help me I might have managed it, but&mdash;you know how
things fell out. I suppose it may be different when you are born to
it&mdash;I am sure I hope so for the sake of all royal personages&mdash;but I am
absolutely certain that my little girl could never support such a
burden and that of a loveless marriage at the same time. I am only
thinking of your happiness, Phil.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, father, I know that. But I’m not nearly as good as you and mother
think. I never dreamed of accepting the King.”
</p>

<p>
“Phil, Phil! then why did you take time to consider his offer?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t look so miserable, father. Can’t you really guess? It was just
after the Queen&mdash;Aunt Ernestine, I mean&mdash;and I had found out about
poor Uncle Cyril. She begged me to keep the King in a good temper, and
this was the only way of doing it. And it was quite successful, you
see. He has been on his best behaviour the whole time, and everything
has gone off well.”
</p>

<p>
“And now?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, now,” Philippa shook herself uncomfortably,&mdash;“now I have to pay
the bill.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ll settle matters with the King for you, Phil. It wasn’t like you
to do such a thing, and I shall be horribly ashamed, but your
intention was good, at any rate.”
</p>

<p>
“No, father, I won’t put it upon you. I am the sinner, and I must bear
the penalty. Yes, I suppose it was rather like doing evil that good
might come, wasn’t it? You can’t think how wicked and miserable I have
felt, and Usk and&mdash;people&mdash;have been so horrid, and I couldn’t
explain. But you see how it was, don’t you? I would have done anything
to help Uncle Cyril.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I see, Phil. But I am more sorry than I can say. I am
afraid&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, father, don’t say you are disappointed in me, or you’ll break my
heart. I don’t care if all the whole world turn their backs upon me,
if my own people trust me still&mdash;indeed I don’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Poor little Phil! I hope it mayn’t be as bad as that.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I can’t help it if it is. Please let the King come up here,
father, if he will have his answer. It’s a horrid thing to do, but it
has got to be done. Would you rather have an ambitious daughter
scheming for a throne, or a wicked flirt entangling the affections of
poor young men and then casting them aside?”
</p>

<p>
Lord Caerleon’s smile was troubled as he went down the stairs, and
Philippa fairly shivered. She felt miserably that her hands were not
clean in the matter, and this unprecedented experience handicapped her
seriously as regarded the approaching interview. With the instinct of
self-protection, she straightened her tie as she heard footsteps
ascending the staircase, tucked away a curl that was straggling over
her brow, and did her best to look absolutely unapproachable, and even
rather indignant at being subjected to such an ordeal. Her blushes she
could not control, however, and King Michael, never a very close
observer, may be pardoned for reading in them, when he reached the
roof, an encouragement to his suit.
</p>

<p>
“You have sent for me to tell me that you will share my throne, Lady
Phil?” he cried, with genuine delight and admiration in his tones.
</p>

<p>
Philippa’s downcast eyes were raised suddenly, and met his with an
indignant flash. It was this young man’s misfortune that he could
never forget his throne. “No, certainly not&mdash;just the opposite,” she
replied promptly.
</p>

<p>
“But you&mdash;you gave me hope.” The King was angry in his turn.
</p>

<p>
“That I never did. It isn’t my fault if you took it.”
</p>

<p>
“But why did you ask for time?”
</p>

<p>
“I didn’t. You insisted I was not to give an answer at once.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you thought you would make a fool of me, Lady Phil?”
</p>

<p>
It was on the tip of Philippa’s tongue to reply that no such process
was needed, but she choked back the retort. “I warned you I should not
change,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“But your taking time to think gave me ground for hope, and all the
considerations I have urged in your hearing the last few days could
only influence you in my favour. Have you given them due thought?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Philippa, with sudden humility, “I haven’t, because it
would be no good. Nothing could ever make me marry you. The truth is
that I didn’t refuse you definitely because I thought you would make
yourself disagreeable to your mother and Uncle Cyril if I did. I
haven’t treated you well, and I am very sorry and very much ashamed.”
</p>

<p>
“You are willing to take the responsibility of throwing me back into
my old way of life, and undoing all the good that the last few months
have effected in the kingdom? I suppose you know that I shall go to
the bad, and that my ruin and the ruin of Thracia will be on your
head?”
</p>

<p>
“I can’t marry you for the sake of your kingdom.”
</p>

<p>
“Then I presume that there is nothing left for me to do but to retire
as gracefully as I can.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, there is something else to do,” said Philippa sharply. “You
ought to learn to take a disappointment like a man, not like a baby.”
</p>

<p>
“Pray continue, Lady Phil. You have the right to rebuke me.”
</p>

<p>
The sarcastic tone roused Philippa’s anger. “I did treat you badly,
and I have told you I am sorry for it,” she cried. “You are very angry
with me, but it never seems to strike you how selfish you have been
all this time. You know that I don’t care a scrap for you, but you
have been trying to get me to marry you by making out that it would be
for the good of your kingdom. You know that I should be
miserable&mdash;perfectly miserable&mdash;but you don’t mind a bit.”
</p>

<p>
“On my honour as a king, I would do my best to make you happy.”
</p>

<p>
“But you couldn’t; how could you? You aren’t the right person.
Besides,” Philippa rushed on hastily, “even if I cared for you I
couldn’t bear to be a Queen. I want to be free, to be able to go about
and do as I like. It would kill me to be cooped up and never able to
get away from people.”
</p>

<p>
“But that is my life, always.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you like it. You would be miserable if you hadn’t people for ever
hanging about and keeping an eye on you. But I have heard all about it
from my father, and though I suppose one could just bear it if one
loved a person very much, still&mdash;well, I don’t love you, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“It is a happy prospect for me, since you consider me unable to
inspire love, and yet think that love alone could induce a woman to
take up such a burden.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, but you might find some one who liked it, some princess who was
born to that sort of thing. Besides, there’s no reason why another
person should not love you, though I don’t.”
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me, Lady Phil&mdash;my selfishness?”
</p>

<p>
“But you must cure that. Don’t talk about going to the bad and ruining
your kingdom because I refuse you. It’s a miserable, cowardly thing to
say. What has your kingdom got to do with me? It’s yours, not mine,
and you are responsible for it. Besides, you can’t pretend that all
the interest you have taken in it lately has been for my sake. You
know you find it interesting yourself. These last few months you have
been a real king, looking into things and forming your own opinion
about them, and your people are pleased. You couldn’t go back to your
old way of leaving everything to your Ministers if you wished. You are
far too fond of power.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, Lady Phil, I believe you are right.” The King looked
surprised, and somewhat ashamed. “After what you have said I can’t
very well be so selfish as to entreat you again to make yourself
miserable for my sake, and I will try to feel glad that I am to be
miserable instead. I may be lonely, but at least you will be happy.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” cried Philippa, her eyes filling with tears. “It’s too
late.”
</p>

<p>
“Allow me to ask you one question,” said King Michael, judiciously
ignoring the tears. “Do you refuse me because you care for any one
else? I think I have the right to ask, for if I am so fortunate as to
be without a rival, there might be some hope for me in the future.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” cried Philippa again. Then, her honest heart fearing that
the negative might convey a false impression, she added, in an agony
of blushes, “It isn’t fair&mdash;it is very unkind of you to ask, because
he has never said anything, but there is some one.”
</p>

<p>
“Thank you. That was all I wanted to know,” said the King. He lifted
Philippa’s reluctant hand and kissed it, then took his leave gravely.
</p>

<p>
“Why, he is a man after all!” said Philippa to herself, as he went
down the steps. She was too miserable to rise and look after him, or
she would have seen him stop in crossing the court, and address
Mansfield, who was driving the gold-fish to distraction by throwing
pebbles into the fountain. Wild horses could not have dragged
Mansfield from the hotel that morning. He had been bearing from the
Chevalier of the duties and emoluments of his new post, but his
interest had been so languid that the financier was half offended, and
had taken his departure without giving him an invitation to accompany
him to Jerusalem, as he had intended. It was a relief to Mansfield to
see him go, for he had only one wish, to be left alone. Philippa was
to make her decision to-day, and he must know the worst. As he sat
upon the edge of the fountain, and took half-hearted shots at the
gold-fish, he became aware that King Michael was approaching him, had
paused beside him. To triumph over his discomfiture, of course!
thought Mansfield, and refused to turn his head and look at his rival.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Mansfield,” said the King, “I yield in your favour the match at
billiards which we were to decide this evening. It was foolish of me
to contest the point, for your success was never in doubt. Only,” his
tone was so significant that Mansfield glanced up in spite of himself,
“let me advise you never again to throw down your cue in disgust
before the end. It is not fair to&mdash;the game.”
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met, and Mansfield read the meaning which underlay the
words.
</p>

<p>
“You are a good fellow!” he said hastily. “I ought to have known that
your mother’s son couldn’t be a cad.”
</p>

<p>
“Allow me to thank you in my mother’s name,” and King Michael went on
his way, lighting a cigarette with a hand which did not shake more
than a very little. Mansfield watched him out of sight, then, waking
as if from a dream, mounted the staircase four or five steps at a
time, and presented himself suddenly before Philippa.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve been a regular beast, Lady Phil,” he cried. “Forgive me.”
</p>

<p>
Philippa raised a tear-stained face with a little start.
</p>

<p>
“Oh!” she said, “it’s you!”
</p>

<p>
“You do forgive me, don’t you?” persisted Mansfield.
</p>

<p>
“But what has it to do with me?” Philippa was on the defensive again.
</p>

<p>
“I thought you were going to marry the King.”
</p>

<p>
“But what has that to do with you?” with the faintest suspicion of a
smile about the corners of the mouth.
</p>

<p>
“It’s because I love you. Oh, Phil, you know it, you have known it for
a long time. It nearly drove me mad to think I had lost you.”
</p>

<p>
Philippa drew herself up. “But how do you know you haven’t?” she
asked. “And, besides, how can you lose a thing you have never had?”
</p>

<p>
Mansfield turned pale, but recovered himself promptly. “Are you trying
to torment me because you know I care for you?” he demanded.
</p>

<p>
“I think you are a little too fond of taking things for granted,” said
Philippa demurely, looking away from him.
</p>

<p>
“Well, there shall be no doubt about it in future,” said Mansfield,
seizing her hands. “Look at me and tell me whether you care for me or
not. Answer me, Phil.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, you are hurting my wrists! You are unkind! I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“If you don’t care for me, it can’t hurt you to look at me and say so.
I will let you go the moment you do.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s very wrong of you to tempt me to tell a story,” said Philippa,
with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
“By all means tell the truth, then.”
</p>

<p>
“But then you won’t let me go. There! I knew it.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you do care? Tell the truth, Phil.”
</p>

<p>
“Just a little.” For one moment the blue eyes met Mansfield’s, then
they were hidden; but he was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
“Ugh! it is cold,” cried Usk, throwing his reins to a gorgeously
apparelled groom. “What a blessing to get in out of this beastly
wind!”
</p>

<p>
It was the second of January, and the genial, if unseasonable, weather
of the past month had been succeeded by hard frosts and biting blasts,
most difficult to cope with in a summer city like Damascus. Usk and Mr
Judson dismounted from their horses and entered the hotel, stamping
vigorously to warm their frozen feet.
</p>

<p>
“A cup of Phil’s hottest tea suggests itself as a suitable
restorative,” Usk went on. “After all, there are some advantages in
her choosing to sit over the stove with her young man instead of
facing the wintry wind. Come in, Judson. The family party is
assembled, you see. What!” with an instantaneous change of tone as his
eye fell upon Philippa’s dark-blue habit and Mansfield’s leggings,
“you unblushing pair of frauds, do you mean to say that you went out,
after all?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, we had a little ride on our own account,” said Philippa calmly.
</p>

<p>
“Your society is always delightful, Usk, but sometimes it is slightly
wearing,” said Mansfield, who had endured a good deal at the hands of
his future brother-in-law during the last three days.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you lazy beggar, I know now why you cried off going to Jerusalem
with the poor old Chevalier! It’s perfectly sickening to see Phil
demoralising you with her attentions when she won’t even give her only
and frozen brother a cup of tea.”
</p>

<p>
“Sit still, Phil. I will pour out the tea,” said Lady Caerleon, with a
loving pat on her daughter’s shoulder. In Philippa’s love-story her
mother renewed her own youth, and in her overflowing happiness forgot
to curb the little caressing ways which she had spent her married life
in trying to repress as un-English.
</p>

<p>
“I wonder we haven’t had a telegram from the Chevalier, or, at any
rate, from Hicks,” said Mansfield, jumping up to pour some more water
into the teapot for Lady Caerleon. “They both promised to let us know
how the transfer of power went off.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s a curious thing,” said Lord Caerleon; “but I met Monckton just
now, and he tells me that no telegrams have come from Jerusalem to-day
or yesterday, and no letters to-day. They hear that there has been a
heavy snowfall in the south, and the Jerusalem trains have not arrived
at Jaffa, so the post may be interrupted; but it seems queer that the
city should be altogether isolated.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope poor old Goldberg hasn’t got snowed up on his journey,”
laughed Usk. “Hicks has a pretty fair idea of making himself
comfortable; but the Chevalier doesn’t know the ropes as he does.
Besides, it must be soothing to be able to turn an honest penny out of
one’s misfortunes by writing a column or two about them.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps the Roumis have refused to budge, after all,” suggested Mr
Judson. “They are quite capable of holding on in spite of their
promises, and the provisional government have no means of making them
turn out.”
</p>

<p>
“That would be a deadlock, indeed,” said Lord Caerleon. “We must
hope&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Why, here’s the Chevalier himself!” cried Usk, and all eyes were
turned to the doorway, where the financier stood like a man in a
dream, travel-stained and bent, with disordered garments.
</p>

<p>
“My dear Chevalier!” said Lord Caerleon, advancing and taking him by
the arm. “Come and sit down; you are ill&mdash;frozen, perhaps.”
</p>

<p>
“I am not ill, but sick at heart. Yerushalem, de holy city, de choy
off de whole earth”&mdash;his voice rose into a cry of agony&mdash;“iss in de
hends off Scythia. O God&mdash;&mdash;” he broke into Hebrew, “the heathen are
come into Thine inheritance.... Oh that Thou wouldst rend the heavens,
that Thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at Thy
presence!”
</p>

<p>
“Cyril’s warning!” cried Lady Caerleon.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said the Chevalier heavily, “he warned me, but I did not see.
None off us saw. We are helpless widout him. O my broder, de cheriot
off Israel and de horsemen dereof! All our labour iss in fain. I hef
beggared myself for dis!”
</p>

<p>
“But how did it happen?” urged Mr Judson. “How was it possible&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Dey hed deir plens laid. Eferythink wass arranched beforehend. Dey
knoo det widout de Count we hed no head to metch Prince Soudaroff’s.
Efen de Armenians&mdash;de irreconcilables&mdash;hed been squared.”
</p>

<p>
“But did you escape?” cried Lord Caerleon; “or were you warned in
time?”
</p>

<p>
“I heard de noose yesterday efenink, Mr Hicks and I were delayed in
our chourney by de snow&mdash;we were fumink to think we hed missed de
great ceremony. Den, ess we approached de City on horsebeck, we were
met by Levinssohn, one off de profissional gofernment, who hed
escaped, and pauced to warn me, lest de enemy should get command of de
Goldberg millions by seizink me. He told us de story.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, and what had happened?” cried everybody.
</p>

<p>
“De transfer off power wass made yesterday mornink in proper form, de
Roumi gofernor hendink ofer to de consuls de charche off de Holy
Places, and to de profissional gofernment de control off de city and
de remainink troops. Dere wass great rechoicink&mdash;light and gledness, a
feast and a goot day. De Letins were celebratink de feast off de
Circumecision, de Greeks, busy preparink to fissit Bethlehem for deir
Christmas Day, were all widin doors. It iss not known how de
disturbance began. I cannot beliefe det my people&mdash;but dey hef bitter
memories to afenche, and dey hef disappointed me griefously off late.
At any rate, de Letins declare det de Chews broke in upon one off deir
serfices, and insulted de worshippers. De noose spread like wildfire,
de Letins poured from all deir churches and confents, and gadered in
de street before de Serai, now become de bureau off de profissional
gofernment. De members were all assembled et deir deliberations.
Suddenly dey found de buildink besieched, so det dey must needs
berricade demselfs in. De consuls, hearink de uproar, ordered de Roumi
troops to clear de street and quell de disturbance, but dey hed been
got at. Dey refuced to mofe except under de orders off de profissional
gofernment, and dose orders it wass impossible to obtain, on account
off de mob riotink between. De consuls, attemptink to use deir
influence, were insulted and derided. Den de Scythian consul propoced
a plen. ‘Dere are here’ said he, ‘two thousand or more Scythian and
Thracian pilgrims, who hef all done military serfice and are amenable
to discipline. In a quarter off an hour I can assemble dem from de
different confents where dey are quartered, and dey will ect ess
police under de orders off de consular body, armed wid sticks and such
oder weapons ess dey can improfice.’ De consuls were doubtful, and de
British consul propoced to arm de Chews instead, but de idea wass
scouted. Arm de wicked bloodthirsty Chews against de mild chentle
Christians&mdash;nefer! De crisis wass acute, and de consuls yielded. Den
appeared a marfel. De two thousand pilgrims were dere&mdash;and a thousand
more wid dem&mdash;and wonderful to relate, dere wass also de Scythian
Cheneral Adrianoff, on pilgrimache, two or three colonels and machors,
seferal captains, lieutenants, sub-lieutenants, all on
pilgrimache&mdash;officers for an army. De pilgrims assembled, profided wid
sticks by de monks. De Cheneral Adrianoff wass neturally put in
command off de force. ‘Shoulder arms!’ and beholt, efery stick wass a
rifle! Emmunition wass immediately forthcomink, and so wass a
machine-gun and its kerrich. De Cheneral Adrianoff marched out to
conquer. De street was quickly cleared, de Cheneral approaches to
release and reassure de members off de gofernment, when a tumult
arices amonk his own men. De Bishop Philaret off Tatarjé hess
discofered a plot on de part off de Chews to blow up de Church off de
Holy Sepulchre wid dynamite. All de Christians off efery sect and
church are transported wid rache. Perish de Chews! De pilgrims dessire
to tear de gofernment to pieces, de Cheneral Adrianoff places de
members under arrest to save dem from dese frients off order. A new
confusion! De Roumis hef been informed by de Bishop det de plot wass
directed also against de Haram-es-Sherif&mdash;de holy place off all Israel
from de beginnink!&mdash;and all de soldiers come runnink to put demselfs
under de orders off de Cheneral to fight against dose wretched Chews.
In fiew off de serious state of affairs, de Cheneral does not
hessitate a moment. He clears de streets, proclaims himself gofernor
off de city ess representink de Emperor off Scythia, and reliefes de
consuls off deir functions ess guardians off de Holy Places. De
British and Pannonian consuls protest; dey cannot ressist, for anoder
miracle hess heppened. Efery Greek or Scythian church and confent and
larche buildink hess become a fort. Cannon are mounted on deir walls,
de monks are soldiers, dere iss emmunition in plenty. To de
stupefection off de consuls, de Cheneral’s forces occupy efery
strategical point, dey command efery corner off de city. Scythia hess
been preparink de ground for many years, now she hess played her game,
and won.”
</p>

<p>
“But this is monstrous, unheard-of!” cried Lord Caerleon. “It will
never be allowed to go on. England&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“England,” said the Chevalier bitterly, “will protest.”
</p>

<p>
“But the rest of the Powers&mdash;Neustria, Hercynia&mdash;&mdash;”
</p>

<p>
“Neustria iss led by de noce by Scythia. Hercynia hess, no doubt,
receifed gretifyink assurances&mdash;her consul did not efen go through de
form off protestink. Pannonia and Magnagrecia will be coerced or
flettered into ecquiescence.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you think it is useless to struggle against this outrageous
usurpation?”
</p>

<p>
“We shell make representations, doubtless. But do we wish to be
deprifed altogeder off de Land we hef bought? We must submit to
circumstances, until”&mdash;there was a cunning gleam in the Chevalier’s
eye&mdash;“we can alter dem. Det will be de task off de remainder off my
life&mdash;to return de poisson of dese reptiles upon deir own head. I tell
you”&mdash;he turned fiercely upon Mr Judson, who had made a deprecating
gesture&mdash;“I would conclude an alliance wid de Enemy off menkind
himself to get dis wronk redressed!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Chevalier!” cried Lady Caerleon, “be patient. Can you not wait
upon God a little longer? Think how wonderfully He has furthered your
plans during the last few years&mdash;how the way of the Kings of the East
has been prepared in spite of what seemed insuperable obstacles.”
</p>

<p>
“Kinks off de East!” cried the Chevalier. “A month ago we were de
kinks off de worrlt! Shell we rest contented wid a gofernment sittink
at Hebron or Nablûs, regulatink metters off commerce and land, when
de Holy City iss in de hends of idolaters, persecutors, creepink
things, and de sons off de apostate are gadered togeder to mock at
us?”
</p>

<p>
“You are misjudging me, Chevalier,” remonstrated Mr Judson, against
whom the last sentence had been directed. “I feel the wrong done as
deeply as you do, although the study of prophecy had warned me that
some blow of the kind might be expected.”
</p>

<p>
“At least leafe us our prophecies!” cried the Chevalier. “May we not
interpret dem in our own way, or must de renegades steal dem also?”
</p>

<p>
“We have no wish to rob you of them; but you must not try to exclude
us Hebrew Christians from the heritage of Israel. Yours are the
adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the promises; but they
are ours, too. Don’t refuse our help. I think you have no idea of the
deep interest taken in the Jewish question in Evangelical circles in
England. Give us leave to do what we can to arouse these English
friends of Zion, and stimulate them to action. Believe me, when the
facts are fully known, there will be such a strong feeling throughout
the country, with regard to the action of Scythia, that the Government
will be forced to insist on her withdrawing from Jerusalem.”
</p>

<p>
“Accept help from de apostate? Nefer, son off a traitor! I will unite
wid Christians, wid agnostics, wid Reformed Chews, wid de Adfersary
himself, in de cause off Zion, but not wid you. You hef no part in de
congregation off Israel.”
</p>

<p>
“Come, Chevalier,” said Lady Caerleon, laying her hand on his clenched
fist, as he shook it furiously at Mr Judson, “you are over-excited.
Rest a little, and have a cup of tea,” she motioned the young people
away, “and then we will talk things over quietly, and see what can be
done.”
</p>

<p>
“Have you thought what all this will mean to Uncle Cyril?” asked
Philippa of Mansfield, as they left the room together. He nodded
gravely.
</p>

<p>
“I know. He came into my mind first thing. It’s awful.”
</p>

<p>
“To see all his work undone, and to know that he can’t put it right!”
wailed Philippa, breaking down suddenly. “I think his heart will
break, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;” the more terrible fear remained unuttered.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know,” said Mansfield diffidently, “I don’t think it will
break him altogether. It might have done once, but he has some one
else to think of now. He will have his wife to comfort and take care
of, and that helps a man, Phil.”
</p>

<p>
“‘It is very good for strength, To know that some one needs you to be
strong,’” reflected Philippa. “Oh, dear!” she cried, with a watery
smile, “I’m quoting poetry again, just as Uncle Cyril told me not to.”
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
It is possible that Philippa’s anxiety might have been somewhat
relieved if she could have read a confidential letter from Queen
Ernestine to her mother, written some months later:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>
“This answer to your loving letter, my dear sister, is for your own
eyes alone. It seems to me (I hope I am mistaken, and that I detect a
criticism where none was intended) that I can read between the lines
something that is not exactly a distrust of my husband, but a fear
lest his terrible trials may have rendered him less regardful of me.
In no case but yours would I condescend to notice such a suspicion;
but I like to think of you, the wife of Cyril’s beloved brother, as a
dear sister of my own, and I cannot bear that you should be in any
doubt as to my happiness. When my beloved’s trial came upon him, I
said to him (I am almost ashamed now to write it) that he must be
content, instead of ruling the world, to make one woman happy, and
this is what he does. Do you realise what that means? He bends all his
powers, his whole mind, to please a woman whose life has been so
desolate that for years it seemed the height of bliss, unattainable
bliss, to be near him, to belong to him. Do you wonder my joy is so
great that I look upon it with trembling? That such a man should
devote himself to ensure the happiness of one whose only claim is that
she loves him&mdash;it is wonderful! How can you say that I have given up
everything for him? I have done nothing&mdash;nothing. You would do far
more for your Carlino; why should you think it strange in me?
</p>

<p>
“Besides, my sister, I have given up nothing that I care for. Court
life has had no attractions for me since I left girlhood behind, at
seventeen, and although Michael was quite willing&mdash;even desirous&mdash;that
I should return to Thracia, I can see that it is better not. It is
characteristic of him to wish to go his own way, and earn his own
experience, and a mother’s anxieties and counsel would quickly become
irksome to him. There is nothing to regret there, you see. I was
cradled in romanticism (alas! my education and my fate were sadly
incongruous), and now at last I am happy. I have the society of the
man I love and of a few faithful friends, the affectionate loyalty of
these poor Arabs, and freedom from the cares of civilisation and
state. The Arabs, indeed, have transferred their allegiance from
myself to Cyril, and I rejoice in the change. We are both studying
their language, for I am anxious to be able to do something to raise
the condition of the women and girls, but he has no need of anything
to bring him into close touch with the men. Under his direction they
are beginning to build themselves more permanent houses instead of
their wretched huts, as well as to repair the ruined walls of the
fortress in case of need. He is interested also in improving their
system of irrigation, so as to utilise much of the water that is at
present wasted, and says that he is a candidate for the honour of
making two bunches of dates grow where only one grew before.
</p>

<p>
“Nor are we shut off altogether from the old life. You may have heard
that we sent poor Stefanovics (who found the desert insupportable) and
his wife back to Brutli, to serve as a means of communication with our
friends in the world, and superintend our arrangements for visitors,
and they do their work admirably. That good, droll Mr Hicks paid us a
visit before returning to America, and the Chevalier Goldberg intends
to brave the terrors of the desert before long. Our last visitor was
dear Fred Mansfield, whose affection for my husband brings the tears
to my eyes. I can see, however (is not this candid of me?), that he
has improved immensely since he has found himself in a more
responsible position. He has gained enormously in readiness and the
habit of command since he was removed from the shadow of Cyril’s
personality. His open-air life suits him, and he has earned golden
opinions from the Chevalier and his confidential agent. Please let
Phil hear this. Fred tells us that he hopes to visit England and bring
her back with him next year, and he showed us the plans for his house.
How I shall delight to see her again!
</p>

<p>
“You hint at our visiting Europe. I am foolishly nervous, I dare say,
but I cannot feel that Cyril is safe anywhere outside the desert. I
have visions of treachery on the part of the Powers if they knew he
was within their reach. Still, if he wishes to make the attempt, he
will hear nothing against his plan from me, even should he decide to
visit Thracia <i>incognito</i>, as Michael has suggested. At present we are
planning a trip to Palmyra, which, with the help of the Arabs, we hope
to accomplish without difficulty, posing as English tourists&mdash;not for
the first time in our lives, you will remember. The opportunity will
be valuable, in allowing my husband to make acquaintance with the
sheikhs of other tribes than ours, who have shown a strong disposition
to invite him to become their head.
</p>

<p>
“It is a curious thing that the Arabs refuse to believe in Cyril’s
illness for a moment. According to them, he has been treated with dire
ingratitude by the Jews, and to mark his displeasure has retired into
the desert, whence he will emerge at the head of an Arab host on the
occasion of some great crisis, and carry all before him. Oh that this
might indeed be the case! Day by day, as I pray for it, I vow upon my
knees that should he ever regain his old powers I will be no hindrance
to his schemes. These few months have had more happiness crowded into
them than I could ever have anticipated, and I will show that I also
can be unselfish. But alas! there is no hope. One terrible day&mdash;I have
told this to no one on earth but yourself&mdash;when the news of the
Scythian seizure of Jerusalem arrived, I thought he would have gone
out of his mind. He walked up and down the room for a long time,
muttering and moving his hands as if he was addressing an assembly,
then he turned suddenly to me, looking like his old self. ‘Paper,
Ernestine!’ he cried. ‘They thought I was done for, did they?’ I gave
him the paper, he sat down, burning with eagerness, and made a few
marks upon the first sheet&mdash;a kind of plan. Then he began to dig the
pen into the paper, and at last threw it down in despair. ‘It’s all
gone, Ernestine, but for a moment I saw the whole thing.’ He called
Paschics, and told him to write and advise the Chevalier to make the
best terms he could for a Jewish Legislature sitting at Nablûs, and
since then he has never once alluded, at least in my hearing, to the
affairs of Palestine. It is unspeakably sad. At ordinary times he
appears perfectly contented, rides with me, hunts with Banics and the
Arabs, plans improvements for the place, reads aloud to us in the
evenings, but when the mail comes in&mdash;&mdash;! Ah, my dear sister, pray
that you may never know such sorrow as I endure then. He reads of all
that is going on&mdash;without him: he sees that he is forgotten where he
was once supreme. He goes up to the ruined colonnade, at the summit of
the palace, and spends hours there alone. Once I crept up after him;
he was gazing out over the desert as Napoleon looked out upon the sea
from the cliffs of St Helena. He does not know I saw him, for I dared
not disturb his mournful reverie. I am only too well aware that I
cannot comfort him, and he would not wish me to behold him in his
desolation. I can but pray for him, and pretend to notice nothing when
he returns, full of kindness, and apologises for his long absence. He
has been reading his letters, he says. On the subject of politics we
never open our lips to one another.&mdash;Believe me to be, my dear Nadia,
your loving sister,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
